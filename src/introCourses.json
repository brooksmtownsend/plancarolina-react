Departmental Involvement Majors are encouraged to participate in AXE (chemistry fraternity) and the undergraduate advisory board. Laboratory Teaching Internships and Assistantships Undergraduates have the opportunity to serve as laboratory teaching assistants for entry-level undergraduate laboratory courses. Special Topics Special topics not offered through the normal course sequence may be pursued through directed reading and registration in CHEM 396 with the approval of the supervising faculty member, advisor, and vice chair for undergraduate studies. An approved learning contract is required, and  Undergraduate Research Almost every undergraduate chemistry major who has undertaken a research project has found it to be an exciting and rewarding experience. The reasons are many. One certainly is that it affords an opportunity to make pioneering discoveries at the forefront of science, using instrumentation and techniques far more sophisticated than those usually encountered in standard laboratory courses.  More than 80 students are involved in undergraduate research projects in chemistry each year. Although successful completion of an undergraduate research project is a requirement for graduation with honors or highest honors (see above), it is not necessary to be a participant in Honors Carolina to undertake a research project.  The usual mechanism for becoming involved in a research project is to register for CHEM 395. This process begins well in advance of a preregistration or registration period with a visit to the Chemistry Student Services office, where a student may obtain a list of undergraduate research opportunities and a form titled Request for Registration in CHEM 395.  Most students begin research during the spring semester of their junior year and continue throughout their senior year. CHEM 395 and CHEM 396  \ftogether may be taken for credit as many times as desired but may be counted for no more than nine hours total credit toward graduation in either the B.A. or B.S. traditional and polymer tracks and for no more than six hours in the B.S. biochemistry track. In the B.S. curriculum CHEM 395 may be counted no more than once as an advanced chemistry elective. UNC–BEST The UNC Baccalaureate Education in Science and Teaching (UNC–BEST) Program is a collaboration between the School of Education and the College of Arts and Sciences and is designed to allow undergraduate science majors interested in teaching high school science the opportunity to earn their science degree and obtain licensure as a North Carolina high school science teacher in four years. UNC–BEST students meet all the degree requirements for their chemistry degree using CHEM 410 as one of their upper-level chemistry courses. UNC–BEST students also fulfill teaching licensure coursework requirements as well as many General Education and elective requirements as they complete 10 credit hours in teaching and learning, including EDUC 516 or EDUC 689 or EDUC 690, EDUC 532, and EDUC 615. During their final semester students engage in a full-time student teaching internship (EDUC 593) and participate in an education leadership seminar (EDUC 601).

Alexanian, Director of Undergraduate Studies eja@email.unc.edu  Donnyell Batts and Jill Fallin, Chemistry Student Services Coordinators chemus@unc.edu  Chemistry is the scientific study of the composition and properties of matter and the investigation of the laws that govern them. All chemists have a common core of knowledge, learned through a highly structured sequence of undergraduate courses in which the content is divided into the classical subdisciplines. Toward the end of students’ progress through their four years of undergraduate study, they may choose to concentrate in one or more areas of chemistry through the courses selected to fulfill the chemistry elective requirements and through undergraduate research.

Special Opportunities in Chemistry Honors in Chemistry Upon the recommendation of the Department of Chemistry, the B.A. or B.S. degree with a major in chemistry may be awarded with honors in chemistry or highest honors in chemistry.  Highest honors in chemistry is a distinction bestowed on a truly exceptional student who has excelled in coursework and who has completed a research project of considerable depth and significance. To attain this distinction the candidate must have nominally satisfied the following guidelines:  \f304         Chemistry Major, B.S.–Biochemistry Track  • B.A. candidates must have achieved a chemistry major grade point average of 3.85 or higher; B.S. candidates, a chemistry major grade point average of 3.75 or higher.  • Have completed at least five courses in chemistry numbered  CHEM 420 or above. For B.A. candidates one of these may be a laboratory course; for B.S. candidates they must all be lecture courses.  • Have completed or be about to complete a research project certified to be of publishable quality by the research advisor and two faculty members appointed by the director of undergraduate studies  Honors in chemistry is a distinction bestowed on an outstanding student who has demonstrated marked competence in the coursework and who has completed a research project of considerable merit. To attain this distinction the candidate must have nominally satisfied the following guidelines:  • Have achieved a chemistry major grade point average of 3.40 or  higher  • Have received no grade below B- in junior- or senior-level chemistry  courses  • Have completed at least three lecture courses in chemistry numbered  CHEM 420 or above  • Have completed or be about to complete a research project certified  to be of honors quality by the research advisor and two faculty members appointed by the vice chair for undergraduate studies  Students who wish to qualify for either of these awards should begin planning their course programs and research activities in the junior year so that ample time and effort may be devoted to succeeding in upper- level courses and research. Departmental Involvement Majors are encouraged to participate in AXE (chemistry fraternity) and the undergraduate advisory board. Laboratory Teaching Internships and Assistantships Undergraduates have the opportunity to serve as laboratory teaching assistants for entry-level undergraduate laboratory courses. Special Topics Special topics not offered through the normal course sequence may be pursued through directed reading and registration in CHEM 396 with the approval of the supervising faculty member, advisor, and vice chair for undergraduate studies. An approved learning contract is required, and students must be registered no later than the end of the first week of classes. Undergraduate Awards Excellent performances by undergraduates in chemistry are recognized by the department through the following awards:  • Francis P. Venable Medal: A medallion and cash award are presented  to the two most outstanding graduating seniors majoring in chemistry in honor of Dr. Francis P. Venable, who was chair of the department, president of the University from 1900 to 1914, and president of the American Chemical Society.  • Emmett Gladstone Rand Premedical Scholarship: A scholarship is  presented to an exceptionally talented graduating senior intending to pursue a career in medicine.  • Jason D. Altom Memorial Award for Undergraduate Research: This  cash award recognizes research potential of an undergraduate chemistry major.  • J. Thurman Freeze Scholarship: This scholarship serves to fund summer research between a student’s junior and senior years. • E.C. Markham Summer Research Fund: The department chair  selects the recipient of this award, who will use the salary to perform research between the junior and senior years.  • Carrie Largent Award for Research Excellence: This award is given  annually to a graduating senior who has excelled in research.  • David L. Stern Scholar: Top students from upper-division laboratory  courses are chosen for this cash award.  • AXE Sophomore Chemist Award: A cash award and certificate are  presented to an outstanding sophomore chemistry major. • James H. Maguire Memorial Award: This award goes to an  outstanding and academically gifted junior honors student majoring in chemistry.  • Tanya R. Ellison Scholarship: A female, junior or senior B.S. chemistry  major is selected for this cash award on the basis of character and academic commitment.  • Hypercube Scholar Award: An outstanding senior majoring in  chemistry is given this chemical software package.  Undergraduate Research Almost every undergraduate chemistry major who has undertaken a research project has found it to be an exciting and rewarding experience. The reasons are many. One certainly is that it affords an opportunity to make pioneering discoveries at the forefront of science, using instrumentation and techniques far more sophisticated than those usually encountered in standard laboratory courses.  More than 80 students are involved in undergraduate research projects in chemistry each year. Although successful completion of an undergraduate research project is a requirement for graduation with honors or highest honors (see above), it is not necessary to be a participant in Honors Carolina to undertake a research project.  The usual mechanism for becoming involved in a research project is to register for CHEM 395. This process begins well in advance of a preregistration or registration period with a visit to the Chemistry Student Services office, where a student may obtain a list of undergraduate research opportunities and a form titled Request for Registration in CHEM 395.  Most students begin research during the spring semester of their junior year and continue throughout their senior year. CHEM 395 and CHEM 396 together may be taken for credit as many times as desired but may be counted for no more than nine hours total credit toward graduation in either the B.A. or B.S. traditional and polymer tracks and for no more than six hours in the B.S. biochemistry track. In the B.S. curriculum CHEM 395 may be counted no more than once as an advanced chemistry elective. UNC–BEST The UNC Baccalaureate Education in Science and Teaching (UNC–BEST) Program is a collaboration between the School of Education and the College of Arts and Sciences and is designed to allow undergraduate science majors interested in teaching high school science the opportunity to earn their science degree and obtain licensure as a North Carolina high school science teacher in four years. UNC–BEST students meet all the degree requirements for their chemistry degree using CHEM 410 as one of their upper-level chemistry courses. UNC–BEST  \fstudents also fulfill teaching licensure coursework requirements as well as many General Education and elective requirements as they complete 10 credit hours in teaching and learning, including EDUC 516 or EDUC 689 or EDUC 690, EDUC 532, and EDUC 615. During their final semester students engage in a full-time student teaching internship (EDUC 593) and participate in an education leadership seminar (EDUC 601).

Planners are involved, for example, in forecasting what futures may hold for a region, guiding the type and location of new development, analyzing transportation systems, encouraging economic development, protecting the environment, mediating diverse interests, and revitalizing urban neighborhoods. They are involved in designing solutions to pressing societal problems such as urban sprawl, unemployment, homelessness, environmental pollution, and urban decay.  City and regional planners work for a variety of public and private organizations. In the public sector local, state, and federal governments all employ city and regional planners. In the private sector, planners work for development companies, consulting firms, and a variety of nonprofit organizations.  For undergraduates the Department of City and Regional Planning offers basic coursework, opportunities for supervised practical experience, and an academic minor. Undergraduate students take courses in the department for several reasons: to learn about cities and planning processes, to enrich or expand their current area of interest in different aspects of urbanization, or to explore the possibility of graduate work leading to a career in planning. Planning courses allow students to see how the arts and sciences can be applied to improve the prosperity and livability of cities, towns, and rural areas. In this way they help students deepen their appreciation of their major field of study. Some planning courses may fulfill General Education requirements.  Advising  The department’s director of dual-degree and undergraduate programs serves as the primary point of contact for students participating in the minor (see contact information above). Student advising and approval of equivalent courses are handled through the director. Students also have a primary academic advisor in Steele Building.  Facilities  The Department of City and Regional Planning is located in New East Building on Cameron Avenue. An important resource available to the department is the Center for Urban and Regional Studies, located in Hickerson House, where the research and service programs of the department are housed. The department has strong ties to the Institute for the Environment. Other research centers that are of interest are  \f310         Department of City and Regional Planning  PLAN–City and Regional Planning Undergraduate-level Courses PLAN 50. First-Year Seminar: This Land Is Your Land. 3 Credits. An issue encountered in managing urban communities and environmental quality concerns rights to land ownership. Environmental regulations limit people's rights to use land as they see fit. This seminar explores processes whereby rights to land, water, and environmental resources of the United States have been acquired, reserved, distributed, and regulated. ",

To participate in this program, the student chooses a research topic in consultation with his or her chosen faculty sponsor and conducts the research during the last two semesters in residence. The research project should represent the equivalent time expenditure of six hours of course credit and is taken as GEOL 691H (fall semester) and GEOL 692H (spring semester).  Upon recommendation of the faculty, students may be awarded the degree with honors or highest honors. Highest honors is reserved for students who have distinguished themselves in both coursework and independent research. In order to obtain this distinction the student must maintain a grade point average of 3.60 or higher and complete a research project that is worthy of peer-reviewed publication. Departmental Involvement The Department of Geological Sciences encourages the active participation of undergraduates in department research, teaching, and social life. In addition to opportunities for experiential education and teaching internships described below, the department has an active Geology Honor Fraternity and Geology Club and regularly sponsors field excursions, career information sessions, and social events. Dates, times, and locations for all events are posted on the Web site and in the main lobby on the first floor of Mitchell Hall. Experiential Education Many geology courses emphasize experiential learning through field and laboratory work. Most degree tracks include a field geology course (GEOL 601 and GEOL 602 or a similar course in another department) that fulfills the experiential education General Education requirement for the College of Arts and Sciences. Additionally, all students are encouraged to contact faculty members about conducting independent research, either as an honors thesis or a senior thesis project.  3 3 3 3  3 3  4  3 3 4 1-12  3 3 3 3 3  3 3 3  \f498         Geological Sciences Major, B.S.–Earth Science Concentration  UNC–BEST The UNC Baccalaureate Education in Science and Teaching (UNC–BEST) Program is a collaboration between the School of Education and the College of Arts and Sciences and is designed to allow undergraduate science majors interested in teaching high school science the opportunity to earn their science degree and obtain licensure as a North Carolina high school science teacher in four years. The program consists of core education classes (EDUC 516 or EDUC 689 or EDUC 690, EDUC 532, EDUC 615, EDUC 593, and EDUC 601) and a teaching methods class (GEOL 412) that is housed in the Department of Geological Sciences.

Study Abroad Although the department has no formalized study abroad program, many students participate in a study abroad program, and some receive credit for geology coursework completed abroad. Students interested in a study abroad program should contact the director of undergraduate studies. Students must receive approval from the director of undergraduate studies prior to taking courses abroad for geology credit. Undergraduate Awards The Op White Prize in Geology, established in 1966, consists of a cash prize and an engraved bronze plaque displayed in the geology office. The award is given annually to the outstanding senior in geology. Field Camp Scholarships Several scholarships for geology field camp are awarded each year from the Grover Murray and Anadarko funds. Undergraduate Research The Department of Geological Sciences encourages qualified undergraduate students to conduct independent research on an interesting geologic topic under the direction of a geological sciences faculty member. This research can be conducted as a one- to four- credit hour project (GEOL 395) or in conjunction with the geology honors program.

It offers multiple tracks for undergraduate study for those interested in German programs (two concentrations), Slavic programs (two concentrations), and Central European studies (one concentration). A major in Germanic and Slavic languages and literatures provides preparatory training that will be useful in government employment; internationally oriented business, journalism, law, and teaching; as well as graduate study in a range of humanistic and social science disciplines.  Advising  Students can complete any concentration, even if they have no prior experience in the language, provided that they begin taking their language courses as first-year students.  All majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele Building. Students should meet regularly with their primary advisor and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester.  However, departmental academic advising is also important for all students majoring or minoring in the department. Current and prospective majors and minors should confer with the department’s director of undergraduate studies (for German literature and culture, German media, arts, and culture), or the department’s Slavic undergraduate advisor (for Russian language and culture and Slavic languages and cultures), or the department’s Central European advisor (for the Central European studies concentration). The director of undergraduate studies, the Slavic undergraduate advisor, or the Central European undergraduate advisor may all approve study abroad, internship, and transfer credit, and/or serve as an honors advisor, as appropriate for the concentrations they work with.  Students seeking certification to teach German or Russian in public schools should consult advisors in the School of Education.  Graduate School and Career Opportunities  In an age of rapid internationalization and globalization, proficiency in a foreign language is no longer just an auxiliary skill but a necessary one. Courses offered in the department make up an important part of a liberal education, and a major can provide excellent preparation for many careers, particularly when the major is combined with courses in business, economics, political science, journalism, and various other  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            511  fields. Recent graduates have entered careers in international business, journalism, publishing, and the travel industry.  A bachelor of arts with a major in Germanic and Slavic languages and literatures also qualifies graduates for positions in the United States State Department and other government agencies, educational organizations, foundations, and travel organizations. The presence of over 100 German and Swiss firms in the Carolinas testifies to the demand for a high degree of German linguistic and cultural literacy in college graduates. The department is also one among very few in the United States that offers a range of critical and/or less commonly taught languages of Eastern Europe and the former USSR. People who know these languages are in particularly high demand in business and government. A graduate who has successfully taken the internationally- recognized business German examination “Wirtschaftsdeutsch als Fremdsprache” at UNC–Chapel Hill has an edge in seeking such positions.  In addition, the demand for language teachers provides career opportunities for those German and Russian majors who receive teaching certification from the School of Education.  German and Slavic majors often go on to graduate programs in comparative literature, linguistics, history, law, international business and management, international relations, professional translation, medicine, and education. Some pursue careers as college professors. Many Chapel Hill German and Slavic majors have been welcomed by the most prestigious graduate programs in the country. The department’s faculty members can assist undergraduate majors in selecting appropriate graduate programs.

Additional Information The curriculum urges that in addition to fulfilling requirements, students continue the study of a foreign language to a level as close as possible to fluency. All majors should also make every effort to include a study abroad program in their undergraduate education, preferably in their sophomore or junior year.  Students must complete all General Education requirements. No courses fulfilling major requirements may be taken Pass/Fail.  Special Opportunities in Global Studies Honors in Global Studies Honors study involves the completion of a substantial piece of original research and the formal presentation of the results in an honors thesis and oral defense. Those who successfully complete the program are awarded their B.A. degree with either honors or highest honors in global studies. Students who wish to submit a thesis for honors in global studies must have at least a 3.3 cumulative grade point average and, under normal circumstances, a 3.5 grade point average in the major and must enroll in GLBL 691H and GLBL 692H. GLBL 692H may count toward the major as a theme or area studies course with departmental approval. GLBL 691H will count as elective credit only. Each prospective honors student must submit a two- to three-page prospectus outlining his/her project in the fall of the junior year. Students accepted into the global studies honors program will enroll in GLBL 691H in the spring of the junior year and GLBL 692H in the fall of the senior year. Study Abroad (recommended, but optional) Global studies majors are strongly urged to gain experiential knowledge of the countries and thematic concerns they are studying through participation in an approved study abroad program appropriate to their areas of concentration. Every effort will be made by the curriculum to  \fUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            551  integrate study abroad courses into the major. Students must receive course approval from the director of undergraduate studies prior to departure for a program abroad. No credit will be given unless programs are preapproved. Undergraduate Awards All majors in the Curriculum in Global Studies who study abroad are considered for two study abroad awards that are presented each year. These funds may be used to defray any expenses associated with studying abroad.  The Michael L. and Matthew L. Boyatt Award Fund provides several meritorious awards each year of no more than $2,500 each. They are designated for majors who want to participate in a study abroad program pertinent to their area of concentration within global studies.  The Laura Hudson Richards Fund provides one award of $2,500 each year to a major in the Curriculum in Global Studies who demonstrates both academic excellence and financial need.  In addition, each spring the curriculum awards the Douglas Eyre Prize to the student writing the best honors thesis. The curriculum also selects an annual recipient of the Anne Scaff Award for service to the curriculum and for internationalizing the College. Students chosen to receive the Eyre Prize and Scaff Award are recognized at the curriculum’s spring commencement ceremony.  \f552         Department of Health Policy and Management  Department of Health Policy and Management Contact Information  Department of Health Policy and Management www.sph.unc.edu/hpm (http://www.sph.unc.edu/hpm) Rosenau Hall, CB# 7411 (919) 966-4609  Karl Umble, Program Director umble@email.unc.edu  Jackie Siler, Student Services/Assistant Registrar, Department of Health Policy and Management jsiler@email.unc.edu  SHOOU-YIH DANIEL LEE, Chair  Introduction  The mission of the BSPH program in health policy and management is to develop responsible graduates who have the necessary knowledge, skills, and values to pursue successful careers in health systems in the United States and abroad.

Dual Bachelor’s–Master’s Degree Program  The Department of Nutrition offers a B.S.P.H.–M.S. dual degree for students who wish to increase their knowledge in nutrition and acquire additional skills in nutrition-based research. This dual degree will be useful for students interested in becoming researchers in industry, program officers for nongovernmental and governmental organizations, project or laboratory managers in academic or nonacademic settings, international workers in nutrition-related programs, and graduate  \fFrank Porter Graham Honor Society, Phi Beta Kappa, and the Joseph Edozien Outstanding Undergraduate Award in Nutrition. Undergraduate Research To enhance students’ general education and help them decide whether a research career is something they might pursue, all B.S.P.H. nutrition students are required to complete nutrition research, either as part of the honors thesis or as independent research.  654         Nutrition Major, B.S.P.H.  students pursuing a doctoral degree or eventually attending medical or another professional school. B.S.P.H.–M.S students will perform advanced research in nutrition and take graduate nutrition and other courses that will provide the information and experience needed to help them choose their career path. Additionally, for those students who are uncertain about whether they wish to enter the department’s doctoral program, the B.S.P.H.–M.S program offers an excellent opportunity to determine whether a more advanced degree would be appropriate. The B.S.P.H.–M.S degree is not specific to any of the department divisions; rather, it builds on the work (both classroom-based and research) begun in the B.S.P.H. program. In summary, the B.S.P.H.–M.S program in nutrition allows students the opportunity to explore nutritional research at an advanced level. The program can be completed in one calendar year (summer, fall, spring) following completion of the B.S.P.H. in nutrition program.  Nutrition B.S.P.H. students interested in the dual-degree program are strongly advised to consult their research advisor and the director of undergraduate studies in nutrition during their sophomore year to discuss eligibility and an appropriate plan of study. For more information see the B.S.P.H.–M.S Dual Degree Nutrition Handbook (http://www.sph.unc.edu/ nutr/degrees).  Special Opportunities in Nutrition Honors in Nutrition The Department of Nutrition provides an opportunity for honors study for qualified students. To be eligible for admission to the honors program students must have, at a minimum, a cumulative grade point average of 3.3 at the beginning of their senior year and must maintain the grade point average throughout the major if they intend to pursue honors. Students register for NUTR 295 (three credits) every semester and then enroll in NUTR 692H (three credits) in their final semester while completing an honors thesis in nutrition. Departmental Involvement The Nutrition Coalition (http://studentlife.unc.edu/organization/ nutritioncoalition) is an organization of students enrolled in one of the department’s five degree programs. The coalition meets several times each semester to address student concerns and to plan service and social activities. Open to the entire University, the coalition strives to broaden the scope of understanding of the various fields and environments in which nutrition is making advances. “A is for Apple” is a student-led, volunteer organization aimed at teaching basic nutrition principles to local elementary school students. Career development workshops are available each year to provide guidance for students applying to graduate and medical schools. Experiential Education Two courses in nutrition include experiential components (NUTR 245 and NUTR 295). However, NUTR 295, available only to nutrition majors, fulfills the General Education experiential education requirement. Undergraduate Awards Nutrition honors research students may apply for the honors undergraduate research awards. The application is available on the Honors Carolina (http://honorscarolina.unc.edu) Web site. Students also may be considered for any of the following awards: Chancellor’s Awards for Excellence in Student Activities and Leadership, The Order of the Golden Fleece, The Order of the Grail-Valkyries, The Order of the Old Well,  \fUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            655  PATH 462.

CHARLES JENNETTE, Brinkhous Distinguished Professor and Chair  Introduction  Pathology is the study of disease, its causes, development, and consequences. It is concerned with basic mechanisms of disease processes (pathobiology) and their structural/functional manifestations. Pathology combines the tools and the basic knowledge from many disciplines, such as molecular biology, cell biology, biochemistry, genetics, immunology, anatomy, and clinical sciences, to clarify the cause (etiology), natural course (pathogenesis), and diagnosis of disease. The department offers several pathology courses appropriate for undergraduate study.  In addition to formal courses, faculty members in the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine of the UNC School of Medicine maintain active research programs and engage in training predoctoral students and postdoctoral fellows in a range of research endeavors. Undergraduate students interested in participating in a hands-on research experience should contact the director of graduate studies in pathology for more information. Contact information is available on the department’s Web site.  Graduate Programs  • M.S. in Pathology (http://catalog.unc.edu/graduate/schools-  departments/pathology-laboratory-medicine)  • Ph.D. in Pathology (http://catalog.unc.edu/graduate/schools-  departments/pathology-laboratory-medicine)  PATH–Pathology Undergraduate-level Courses PATH 128.
