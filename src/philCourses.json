A formal program in American studies was established in 1968, and exciting additions in American Indian and indigenous studies, Southern studies, and global American studies have been added in the past two decades. The Department of American Studies has a tradition of vigorous teaching and an innovative curriculum that offers stimulating opportunities to study the United States and the diversity and influence of its peoples, institutions, texts, performances, and places. In addition, each of our areas of major concentration incorporates global and comparative perspectives. The department’s commitment to interdisciplinary approaches empowers students to value the nation’s complexity by engaging with a variety of historical, literary, artistic, political, social, cultural, legal, racial, ethnic, and ethnographic perspectives within and beyond the United States. American studies majors graduate with a comprehension of the dynamics of American culture that prepares them to make a responsible and critical difference in the variety of professions they choose to pursue.  The American studies major offers five areas of concentration, each with its own distinct degree requirements.  Advising  All majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele Building. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with their advisor and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. The department’s director of undergraduate studies works with current and prospective majors and minors by appointment. Further information on courses, opportunities, and honors theses may be obtained from the department’s Web site.  Graduate School and Career Opportunities  American studies is an excellent liberal arts major for students interested in graduate and professional school study. The major prepares students for graduate work in fields such as American history and literature. After receiving the baccalaureate degree, American studies majors consistently have been accepted in law and business schools, which are interested in students with a broad, interdisciplinary undergraduate background. American studies provides a solid basis for a variety of career choices, including public service, business, teaching, museum curation, and journalism. The folklore concentration and minor are a productive component of study for those preparing for graduate school in anthropology, communication, journalism, music, and folklore itself,  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            117  as well as for those planning careers in museum curation, public arts presentation, and music production.

Folklore also offers a two-course honors program: FOLK 691H in the fall semester and FOLK 692H in the spring semester. Students must propose their thesis and contract with a faculty advisor during the semester prior to the beginning of their senior year. For each semester of honors work, thesis students must submit a signed learning contract to the Department of American Studies during the registration period. During the two semesters devoted to honors work, students conduct individual research and prepare an honors thesis under the supervision of a faculty member. Students also will attend a weekly seminar at the discretion of the advisor. Students must maintain a 3.3 cumulative grade point average to be eligible. With the approval of the associate or the assistant dean for honors, students with a slightly lower average who have a reasonable expectation of meeting the requirement within one more semester may embark upon the honors thesis, understanding that if they do not attain the 3.3 standard they may continue the research project as independent study but are not eligible to graduate with honors or highest honors. Experiential Education The Department of American Studies offers a seminar on Service Learning in America (AMST 398) and offers credits for approved internship projects (AMST 493). Students have learned about American studies by serving the community in museums, schools, social agencies, and other cultural institutions. Study Abroad The Department of American Studies encourages students to consider a semester or more of study abroad and has developed close relations with several American studies programs in different countries. Studying American experience in international contexts is an integral part of understanding the place and influence of the United States in the world. Student learning is enhanced by the perspectives gained by examining how American subjects are taught in universities around the globe as well as by encountering the international students who enroll in American studies courses in Chapel Hill. Study abroad offers students of folklore the opportunity to understand the rich vernacular and traditional cultures of other parts of the world from both a local and a comparative perspective. Students can receive American studies major credit for selected study abroad programs and are encouraged to make study abroad part of their academic plans. Study abroad courses can count toward the international American studies major or minor. Students interested in this experience should consult with the director of undergraduate studies or with the Study Abroad Office about international exchange programs sponsored by UNC–Chapel Hill.

These realms are often deeply grounded in tradition; this doesn’t mean, however, that they’re always or necessarily old. Just as communities change their own sense of self in response to shifting social, political, and economic realities, so too does the artistry they create evolve. Folklore thus moves beyond the study of the old and time- honored to explore emergent meanings and cultural forms. Trending tweets, food trucks, slam poetry, and hip hop freestyling are just as relevant to folklorists’ study as are string-band tunes, Cherokee quilts, family recipes, and blues. The communities that our students study are equally broad, ranging from Lumbee sheetrock workers and Latino line cooks to urban homesteaders and Black Lives Matter activists. The main way that we explore contemporary folklore, in turn, is ethnographic fieldwork, the real-world study of people’s lives in everyday settings, grounded in conversation and participatory engagement.

Special Opportunities in American Studies Honors in American Studies The American studies major offers a two-course honors program: AMST 691H in the fall semester and AMST 692H in the spring semester. Folklore also offers a two-course honors program: FOLK 691H in the fall semester and FOLK 692H in the spring semester. Students must propose their thesis and contract with a faculty advisor during the semester prior to the beginning of their senior year. For each semester of honors work, thesis students must submit a signed learning contract to the Department of American Studies during the registration period. During the two semesters devoted to honors work, students conduct individual  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            141  research and prepare an honors thesis under the supervision of a faculty member. Students also will attend a weekly seminar at the discretion of the advisor. Students must maintain a 3.3 cumulative grade point average to be eligible. With the approval of the associate or the assistant dean for honors, students with a slightly lower average who have a reasonable expectation of meeting the requirement within one more semester may embark upon the honors thesis, understanding that if they do not attain the 3.3 standard they may continue the research project as independent study but are not eligible to graduate with honors or highest honors. Experiential Education The Department of American Studies offers a seminar on Service Learning in America (AMST 398) and offers credits for approved internship projects (AMST 493). Students have learned about American studies by serving the community in museums, schools, social agencies, and other cultural institutions.

Anthropological expertise has special application for hidden histories and the ancient past; the intersection of human biology and ecology; and the way communities create and use meaning, values, and history in everyday life. We support studies, research, and professional applications in these areas with three programs of foundational training: archaeology; human biology, ecology, and evolution; and sociocultural anthropology.  Cutting across these specializations, the department supports concentrations that integrate anthropology’s diverse expertise to address contemporary world problems. Programming in these areas helps students connect their anthropological studies to work and life beyond the University. Current concentrations focus on health, medicine, and humanity; heritage and unwritten histories; global engagement; race, place and power; and food, environment, and sustainability.  Together, the Department of Anthropology’s programs and concentrations offer the undergraduate student one of the best introductions possible to our biological and cultural pasts and to our contemporary world. Anthropology majors thus develop the written and oral skills needed to live and work in a complex world marked by an accelerated rate of environmental, social, and cultural change. Anthropology majors acquire general knowledge and skills valued within a large number of occupations and professions, including but not limited to professional anthropology.  Advising  All majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele Building. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with their advisor and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. The department’s director of undergraduate studies (see “Contact Information” above) works with current and prospective majors and minors by appointment. Students are encouraged to consult with the director of undergraduate studies about course choices and field work opportunities. Departmental academic advising is particularly important for those majors who are considering going on to graduate school. Further information on courses, undergraduate research opportunities, and the honors program may be obtained from the department’s Web site.  Graduate School and Career Opportunities  There are three basic career paths for B.A.-level anthropology majors:  • Anthropology majors have open to them all of the career options  of any student with a bachelor of arts degree in the liberal arts and social sciences, with the added advantage that they surely are more  prepared than most in the growing international arena of business, government, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). The resources and professional staff of University Career Services and the department’s director of undergraduate studies can provide guidance.  • Anthropology majors can seek a career that puts their anthropology  degree directly into practice.  • Lastly, anthropology majors can continue with graduate education in order to seek a career in education, either as a social studies teacher in a school or a professor in a university.

Also subject to the approval of the archaeology major advisor, field schools sponsored by Study Abroad or other universities may be used to fulfill the archaeological practice field experience requirement.  Special Opportunities in Archaeology Honors in Archaeology Students with a grade point average of 3.3 or higher are eligible to pursue a degree with honors. A student who wishes to take this track should identify and contact a faculty thesis advisor before the end of the junior year. During the senior year the student enrolls in a two-semester course sequence, ARCH 691H and ARCH 692H, which provides the opportunity to carry out an independent research project and write a thesis under the direction of the faculty advisor. Prior to registering for the honors courses, the student and faculty mentor must fill out a contract and have it signed by the curriculum’s director of undergraduate studies. The thesis is evaluated by a committee consisting of the advisor and two readers. The advisor and at least one reader must be members of the Curriculum in Archaeology’s faculty. A student who successfully completes the thesis may be awarded honors or highest honors by the committee. Highest honors is awarded only in cases where the thesis is judged to be exceptional in comparison to other such works. Research Laboratories of Archaeology Founded in 1939, the Research Laboratories of Archaeology (RLA) was the first center for the study of North Carolina archaeology. Serving the interests of students, scholars, and the general public, it is currently one of the leading institutes for archaeological teaching and research in the South. Located within the College of Arts and Sciences, it provides support and research opportunities for UNC–Chapel Hill students  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            173  working not only in North Carolina but also throughout the Americas and overseas. Duke–UNC Consortium for Classical and Mediterranean Archaeology (CCMA) The Duke–UNC Consortium for Classical and Mediterranean Archaeology represents a collaboration between the institutions in order to enhance archaeology curricula and concentrations in the respective departments and programs in archaeology. The consortium fosters an interdisciplinary dialogue on methods, theory, and practice in classical archaeology and material culture, providing students access to coursework, seminars, excavations, and other research opportunities; academic advising; and avenues for curricular and extracurricular interaction. Experiential Education The development of skills and perspectives beyond the classroom is considered central to the curriculum in archaeology. Hands-on training in field archeology provides students with the basic tools not only necessary for graduate training and advanced research in archaeology, but also for careers in cultural resource and heritage management through government agencies, contract firms, and museums. Developing an understanding of context and physical environment in archaeology requires field and laboratory experiences that are impossible to teach effectively in the classroom. Excavation and laboratory experiences allow students to participate directly in faculty research and to learn firsthand important aspects of the research process. Two or more field schools in archaeology are generally offered during summer sessions through the Study Abroad Office by faculty from the departments of anthropology, classics, religious studies, and history. In addition, many faculty research associates offer laboratory experiences through independent study projects and internships. These field work and laboratory experiences are designed to enhance the classroom training, allowing students to work as assistants to field archaeologists and specialists—such as surveyors, archaeological architects, palaeoethnobotanists, zooarchaeologists, biological anthropologists, and geomorphologists—learning firsthand various aspects of data recovery, processing, and interpretation associated with archaeological field projects.

From a strong central core in the traditional practices of making and interpreting art, the faculty and students at UNC–Chapel Hill move out in innovative and personal directions. We cultivate exchange between studio art and art history and offer maximum flexibility within our individual programs.  The art history curriculum is designed to help students acquire an individual perspective on their own values and beliefs and on their places in a society increasingly shaped by visual communication. Majors and minors in art history become acquainted with the historical significance, cultural diversity, and intellectual richness of human artistic traditions, enabling students to investigate the complex roles played by the arts in a variety of social contexts.  The studio art program encourages experimentation, crossing boundaries, and hybrid processes as well as engaging the history and traditions of art. Through directed practice and creative research, faculty work closely with students to stimulate aesthetic and intellectual inquiry, impart portable skills, and motivate self-exploration to help students create outstanding works of art.  Students may choose from a range of studio coursework designed to develop both skills and a personal creative vision. Students develop two critical skills: the means of self-expression and techniques for creative thinking. While the undergraduate program focuses on the fine arts, the course of study nonetheless offers a sound foundation for students to move into art education, design fields, and other art-related careers as well as preparation for further study or careers in the fine arts.  Credit by Examination  Students who pass the Advanced Placement (AP) examination in art history and earn a score of 4 or 5 will receive credit for ARTH 152.  Students who fulfill the studio art portfolio requirements for the Advanced Placement (AP) examination and earn a score of 4 or 5 will receive placement only (PL) for ARTS 102, ARTS 103, or ARTS 104.  Students who score a 3 can petition to waive relevant prerequisites via portfolio review, although no course credit will be given. Students earning a score of 6 or higher on the International Baccalaureate (IB) portfolio will receive placement only (PL) for ARTS 104. Students who score a 5 on the IB may petition for a portfolio review to determine if they can exempt ARTS 102 or ARTS 104. Advanced Placement by Portfolio Review In addition to the threshold scores mentioned above, art majors who have broad experience in visual art may petition to exempt foundation requirements by submitting a portfolio for review. If the review is successful, students do not receive credit for these courses; rather, the credit hours are redistributed to the studio concentration or elective requirement of the major. Portfolio requirements are modeled after the College Board Advanced Placement portfolio guidelines. These guidelines are available from the director of undergraduate studies in studio art, the student services administrator, or on the art majors’ Sakai site. Portfolios are reviewed annually in September. Contact the director of undergraduate studies in studio art at the beginning of the fall semester to make arrangements.  Advising  All majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele Building. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with their advisor and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. The department’s directors of undergraduate studies and undergraduate advisors work with current and prospective majors by appointment (see “Contact Information” above). On request, art history majors may be assigned an individual faculty advisor. The studio area also holds general advising sessions prior to registration each semester. Departmental academic advising is particularly important for those majors who are considering honors thesis work or graduate school. Further information on courses, undergraduate research opportunities, and the honors program may be obtained from the department’s Web site.  Additionally, special informational sessions are held periodically to guide students on awards, study abroad, internships, and research opportunities (especially the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships). These sessions are announced on the art majors' listserv and Sakai site, as well as by posters in the Hanes Art Center and Art Lab.

Departmental Involvement The department sponsors a variety of cultural events—lectures, film series, performances, and more—as well as social and informational events where students can get to know each other and faculty members in an informal setting. Faculty members in the department serve as advisors to some of the many Asia-related student organizations on campus, such as the Japan Club, Chinese Conversation Club, and more. Languages across the Curriculum The department participates in the Languages across the Curriculum (LAC) program, offering a one-credit-hour discussion section that is conducted in Arabic but associated with a variety of courses offered in English, both in Asian studies and in such other departments as history or religious studies. This LAC recitation section offers students the opportunity to use their Arabic language skills in a broader intellectual context. Libraries The University has rich collections of books and periodicals on Asia in the relevant Asian languages, as well as in English and other Western languages. Experts in the collection development department for Davis Library are available to help students locate the materials they need. The University also has an outstanding collection of Asian films and other audiovisual materials, housed in the Media Resource Center at House Library. Speaker Series The department sponsors an annual speaker series. These events include lectures by prominent artists, scholars, and writers and are often cosponsored by other units on campus. Study Abroad UNC–Chapel Hill sponsors several study programs (summer, semester, and yearlong) in China, Egypt, India, Israel, Japan, Jordan, Korea, Mongolia, Morocco, Nepal, Oman, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, and Vietnam. Asian studies majors are strongly encouraged to take advantage of these opportunities to live and study in an Asian setting; UNC-approved study abroad programs also satisfy the experiential education requirement. For further information on these programs and other study abroad opportunities in Asia, contact the UNC Study Abroad Office. Undergraduate Research The department actively encourages undergraduate student research. Through classes, advising, and office hours, faculty members guide students toward defining areas of interest, conceptualizing research questions, identifying sources, and writing academic papers.

Study Abroad UNC–Chapel Hill sponsors several study programs (summer, semester, and yearlong) in China, Egypt, India, Israel, Japan, Jordan, Korea, Mongolia, Morocco, Nepal, Oman, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, and Vietnam. Asian studies majors are strongly encouraged to take advantage of these opportunities to live and study in an Asian setting; UNC-approved study abroad programs also satisfy the experiential education requirement. For further information on these programs and other study abroad opportunities in Asia, contact the UNC Study Abroad Office. Undergraduate Research The department actively encourages undergraduate student research. Through classes, advising, and office hours, faculty members guide students toward defining areas of interest, conceptualizing research questions, identifying sources, and writing academic papers. Students may pursue research through independent studies, the senior honors thesis, and study abroad research opportunities such as the Burch Fellowship. Asian studies students have received a variety of competitive research support and travel awards, won regional contests for undergraduate papers, published papers in academic journals, and presented their work at such events as the Senior Colloquium in Asian Studies and the campuswide Annual Celebration of Undergraduate Research in the spring.

The department oversees a joint graduate and undergraduate program at these institutions. While a complete curriculum is offered on the UNC–Chapel Hill campus, students can elect to take any number of classes at NC State. The joint program also leverages the industry resources in Research Triangle Park, located roughly half way between the two campuses, providing unique opportunities for students.  Biomedical engineering is a profession that develops and applies engineering knowledge and experience to solve problems in biology and medicine and to enhance health care. Biomedical engineers are professionally trained to combine the rigors of medical and biological studies with the power of engineering analysis and design. People become biomedical engineers to be of service to others, to enjoy the excitement of understanding living systems, and to use state-of-the- art science and technology to solve the complex problems of medical care. The emphasis in biomedical engineering is on finding solutions by researching, testing, and applying medical, biological, chemical, electrical, and materials engineering approaches. Biomedical engineers are unique individuals who make contributions to health care that are both satisfying to themselves and beneficial to others.  Facilities  The Department of Biomedical Engineering houses an undergraduate student design laboratory. It contains equipment for rapid prototyping (three-dimensional printer and laser cutter), as well as electronics and microcontroller design and development. Students also use facilities in other departments that have laboratory-based courses. The BeAM Makerspace facilities are available to all UNC students, and these facilities house a variety of mechanical and electronic fabrication tools. More information is available at the UNC BeAM Web site.  Graduate School and Career Opportunities  Many students from this program have pursued further education in graduate school in biomedical engineering. Our alumni have attended many of the top-ranked biomedical engineering programs. In addition, some students have pursued graduate degrees in other disciplines in engineering, as well as related fields such as microbiology, sports physiology, public health, and business/engineering management, among others. Students have also been accepted into clinical programs such as medical, dental, physical therapy, and pharmacy schools (in many  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            277  cases, the student must take several additional courses to meet the requirements for clinical programs).  For those interested in going directly into a career, biomedical engineering is one of the fastest growing career opportunities. Graduates are employed by hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, medical device and testing companies, government agencies, universities, and medical schools.

Special Opportunities in Chemistry Honors in Chemistry Upon the recommendation of the Department of Chemistry, the B.A. or B.S. degree with a major in chemistry may be awarded with honors in chemistry or highest honors in chemistry.  Highest honors in chemistry is a distinction bestowed on a truly exceptional student who has excelled in coursework and who has completed a research project of considerable depth and significance. To attain this distinction the candidate must have nominally satisfied the following guidelines:  • B.A. candidates must have achieved a chemistry major grade point average of 3.85 or higher; B.S. candidates, a chemistry major grade point average of 3.75 or higher.  • Have completed at least five courses in chemistry numbered  CHEM 420 or above. For B.A. candidates one of these may be a laboratory course; for B.S. candidates they must all be lecture courses.  • Have completed or be about to complete a research project certified to be of publishable quality by the research advisor and two faculty members appointed by the director of undergraduate studies  Honors in chemistry is a distinction bestowed on an outstanding student who has demonstrated marked competence in the coursework and who has completed a research project of considerable merit. To attain this distinction the candidate must have nominally satisfied the following guidelines:  • Have achieved a chemistry major grade point average of 3.40 or  higher  • Have received no grade below B- in junior- or senior-level chemistry  courses  students must be registered no later than the end of the first week of classes. Undergraduate Awards Excellent performances by undergraduates in chemistry are recognized by the department through the following awards:  • Francis P. Venable Medal: A medallion and cash award are presented  to the two most outstanding graduating seniors majoring in chemistry in honor of Dr. Francis P. Venable, who was chair of the department, president of the University from 1900 to 1914, and president of the American Chemical Society.  • Emmett Gladstone Rand Premedical Scholarship: A scholarship is  presented to an exceptionally talented graduating senior intending to pursue a career in medicine.  • Jason D. Altom Memorial Award for Undergraduate Research: This  cash award recognizes research potential of an undergraduate chemistry major.  • J. Thurman Freeze Scholarship: This scholarship serves to fund summer research between a student’s junior and senior years. • E.C.

Departmental Involvement Majors are encouraged to participate in AXE (chemistry fraternity) and the undergraduate advisory board. Laboratory Teaching Internships and Assistantships Undergraduates have the opportunity to serve as laboratory teaching assistants for entry-level undergraduate laboratory courses. Special Topics Special topics not offered through the normal course sequence may be pursued through directed reading and registration in CHEM 396 with the approval of the supervising faculty member, advisor, and vice chair for undergraduate studies. An approved learning contract is required, and  Undergraduate Research Almost every undergraduate chemistry major who has undertaken a research project has found it to be an exciting and rewarding experience. The reasons are many. One certainly is that it affords an opportunity to make pioneering discoveries at the forefront of science, using instrumentation and techniques far more sophisticated than those usually encountered in standard laboratory courses.  More than 80 students are involved in undergraduate research projects in chemistry each year. Although successful completion of an undergraduate research project is a requirement for graduation with honors or highest honors (see above), it is not necessary to be a participant in Honors Carolina to undertake a research project.  The usual mechanism for becoming involved in a research project is to register for CHEM 395. This process begins well in advance of a preregistration or registration period with a visit to the Chemistry Student Services office, where a student may obtain a list of undergraduate research opportunities and a form titled Request for Registration in CHEM 395.  Most students begin research during the spring semester of their junior year and continue throughout their senior year. CHEM 395 and CHEM 396  \ftogether may be taken for credit as many times as desired but may be counted for no more than nine hours total credit toward graduation in either the B.A. or B.S. traditional and polymer tracks and for no more than six hours in the B.S. biochemistry track. In the B.S. curriculum CHEM 395 may be counted no more than once as an advanced chemistry elective. UNC–BEST The UNC Baccalaureate Education in Science and Teaching (UNC–BEST) Program is a collaboration between the School of Education and the College of Arts and Sciences and is designed to allow undergraduate science majors interested in teaching high school science the opportunity to earn their science degree and obtain licensure as a North Carolina high school science teacher in four years. UNC–BEST students meet all the degree requirements for their chemistry degree using CHEM 410 as one of their upper-level chemistry courses. UNC–BEST students also fulfill teaching licensure coursework requirements as well as many General Education and elective requirements as they complete 10 credit hours in teaching and learning, including EDUC 516 or EDUC 689 or EDUC 690, EDUC 532, and EDUC 615. During their final semester students engage in a full-time student teaching internship (EDUC 593) and participate in an education leadership seminar (EDUC 601).

Special Opportunities in Chemistry Honors in Chemistry Upon the recommendation of the Department of Chemistry, the B.A. or B.S. degree with a major in chemistry may be awarded with honors in chemistry or highest honors in chemistry.  Highest honors in chemistry is a distinction bestowed on a truly exceptional student who has excelled in coursework and who has completed a research project of considerable depth and significance. To attain this distinction the candidate must have nominally satisfied the following guidelines:  \f304         Chemistry Major, B.S.–Biochemistry Track  • B.A. candidates must have achieved a chemistry major grade point average of 3.85 or higher; B.S. candidates, a chemistry major grade point average of 3.75 or higher.  • Have completed at least five courses in chemistry numbered  CHEM 420 or above. For B.A. candidates one of these may be a laboratory course; for B.S. candidates they must all be lecture courses.  • Have completed or be about to complete a research project certified to be of publishable quality by the research advisor and two faculty members appointed by the director of undergraduate studies  Honors in chemistry is a distinction bestowed on an outstanding student who has demonstrated marked competence in the coursework and who has completed a research project of considerable merit. To attain this distinction the candidate must have nominally satisfied the following guidelines:  • Have achieved a chemistry major grade point average of 3.40 or  higher  • Have received no grade below B- in junior- or senior-level chemistry  courses  • Have completed at least three lecture courses in chemistry numbered  CHEM 420 or above  • Have completed or be about to complete a research project certified  to be of honors quality by the research advisor and two faculty members appointed by the vice chair for undergraduate studies  Students who wish to qualify for either of these awards should begin planning their course programs and research activities in the junior year so that ample time and effort may be devoted to succeeding in upper- level courses and research. Departmental Involvement Majors are encouraged to participate in AXE (chemistry fraternity) and the undergraduate advisory board. Laboratory Teaching Internships and Assistantships Undergraduates have the opportunity to serve as laboratory teaching assistants for entry-level undergraduate laboratory courses. Special Topics Special topics not offered through the normal course sequence may be pursued through directed reading and registration in CHEM 396 with the approval of the supervising faculty member, advisor, and vice chair for undergraduate studies. An approved learning contract is required, and students must be registered no later than the end of the first week of classes. Undergraduate Awards Excellent performances by undergraduates in chemistry are recognized by the department through the following awards:  • Francis P. Venable Medal: A medallion and cash award are presented  to the two most outstanding graduating seniors majoring in chemistry in honor of Dr. Francis P. Venable, who was chair of the department, president of the University from 1900 to 1914, and president of the American Chemical Society.  • Emmett Gladstone Rand Premedical Scholarship: A scholarship is  presented to an exceptionally talented graduating senior intending to pursue a career in medicine.  • Jason D.

Undergraduate Research Almost every undergraduate chemistry major who has undertaken a research project has found it to be an exciting and rewarding experience. The reasons are many. One certainly is that it affords an opportunity to make pioneering discoveries at the forefront of science, using instrumentation and techniques far more sophisticated than those usually encountered in standard laboratory courses.  More than 80 students are involved in undergraduate research projects in chemistry each year. Although successful completion of an undergraduate research project is a requirement for graduation with honors or highest honors (see above), it is not necessary to be a participant in Honors Carolina to undertake a research project.  The usual mechanism for becoming involved in a research project is to register for CHEM 395. This process begins well in advance of a preregistration or registration period with a visit to the Chemistry Student Services office, where a student may obtain a list of undergraduate research opportunities and a form titled Request for Registration in CHEM 395.  Most students begin research during the spring semester of their junior year and continue throughout their senior year. CHEM 395 and CHEM 396 together may be taken for credit as many times as desired but may be counted for no more than nine hours total credit toward graduation in either the B.A. or B.S. traditional and polymer tracks and for no more than six hours in the B.S. biochemistry track. In the B.S. curriculum CHEM 395 may be counted no more than once as an advanced chemistry elective. UNC–BEST The UNC Baccalaureate Education in Science and Teaching (UNC–BEST) Program is a collaboration between the School of Education and the College of Arts and Sciences and is designed to allow undergraduate science majors interested in teaching high school science the opportunity to earn their science degree and obtain licensure as a North Carolina high school science teacher in four years. UNC–BEST students meet all the degree requirements for their chemistry degree using CHEM 410 as one of their upper-level chemistry courses. UNC–BEST  \fstudents also fulfill teaching licensure coursework requirements as well as many General Education and elective requirements as they complete 10 credit hours in teaching and learning, including EDUC 516 or EDUC 689 or EDUC 690, EDUC 532, and EDUC 615. During their final semester students engage in a full-time student teaching internship (EDUC 593) and participate in an education leadership seminar (EDUC 601).

Planners are involved, for example, in forecasting what futures may hold for a region, guiding the type and location of new development, analyzing transportation systems, encouraging economic development, protecting the environment, mediating diverse interests, and revitalizing urban neighborhoods. They are involved in designing solutions to pressing societal problems such as urban sprawl, unemployment, homelessness, environmental pollution, and urban decay.  City and regional planners work for a variety of public and private organizations. In the public sector local, state, and federal governments all employ city and regional planners. In the private sector, planners work for development companies, consulting firms, and a variety of nonprofit organizations.  For undergraduates the Department of City and Regional Planning offers basic coursework, opportunities for supervised practical experience, and an academic minor. Undergraduate students take courses in the department for several reasons: to learn about cities and planning processes, to enrich or expand their current area of interest in different aspects of urbanization, or to explore the possibility of graduate work leading to a career in planning. Planning courses allow students to see how the arts and sciences can be applied to improve the prosperity and livability of cities, towns, and rural areas. In this way they help students deepen their appreciation of their major field of study. Some planning courses may fulfill General Education requirements.  Advising  The department’s director of dual-degree and undergraduate programs serves as the primary point of contact for students participating in the minor (see contact information above). Student advising and approval of equivalent courses are handled through the director. Students also have a primary academic advisor in Steele Building.  Facilities  The Department of City and Regional Planning is located in New East Building on Cameron Avenue. An important resource available to the department is the Center for Urban and Regional Studies, located in Hickerson House, where the research and service programs of the department are housed. The department has strong ties to the Institute for the Environment. Other research centers that are of interest are  \f310         Department of City and Regional Planning  PLAN–City and Regional Planning Undergraduate-level Courses PLAN 50. First-Year Seminar: This Land Is Your Land. 3 Credits. An issue encountered in managing urban communities and environmental quality concerns rights to land ownership. Environmental regulations limit people's rights to use land as they see fit. This seminar explores processes whereby rights to land, water, and environmental resources of the United States have been acquired, reserved, distributed, and regulated. "

The program of study is designed to give students a basic knowledge of the art and architecture of the Greeks and Romans and to introduce them to the use of archaeology in the reconstruction of the past, including Egypt and the ancient Near East. Majors in classical archaeology may not elect a minor in the classical language that they use to satisfy their major requirements, although they may elect a minor in the other classical language. Students interested in majoring in classical archaeology should consult the department as early as possible.

Classical Archaeology (CLAR) course descriptions (p. 313).  Special Opportunities in Classics Honors in Classics Classics majors wishing to take part in the departmental honors program during their senior year must have a grade point average of at least 3.3 at the beginning of their senior year and maintain an average no lower than this through their final semester in order to be eligible for honors consideration.  The program consists of two courses, CLAS 691H and CLAS 692H, taken sequentially in the fall and spring semesters. CLAS 691H involves a directed reading in Greek, Latin, or archaeology in a general area of the student’s interest and is conducted under the supervision of a faculty member chosen by the student to serve as the honors advisor. Requirements of the course include the preparation of a thesis prospectus with accompanying bibliography and a preliminary oral examination by the student’s thesis committee. A grade for CLAS 691H is assigned on the basis of the total semester’s work. CLAS 692H entails the writing of the thesis under the direction of the honors advisor and a final oral defense before the candidate’s committee. This body, in turn, reports its judgment to the department. If a degree with honors is to be awarded, a recommendation for either honors or, for particular merit, highest honors is made. Additional Opportunities The Department of Classics supports a number of activities, including informal reading groups; the local chapter of Eta Sigma Phi, the national undergraduate classics honorary society; and annual oral performances and prize competitions in reciting and translating Greek and Latin  \ftexts. Several of the prize competitions involve substantial cash awards. Opportunities for undergraduate research include especially the senior honors thesis and participation in archaeological fieldwork as research assistants. The department encourages majors and minors to take part in summer archaeological field projects; there are current field projects directed or codirected by department faculty members and associates at Azoria in Crete and at Huqoq and Omrit in Israel. Other opportunities for study abroad include the programs of the Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies in Rome and the College Year in Athens, and the exchange with King’s College London. A number of departmental fellowships and other funding opportunities can help support participation in archaeological field projects and other research projects. Lastly, the Duke–UNC Consortium for Classical and Mediterranean Archaeology provides archaeology students access to coursework, seminars, excavations and other research opportunities, academic advising, and avenues for curricular and extracurricular interaction across both institutions.

Through its teaching, research, and service, the Department of Communication addresses the many ways communication functions to create, sustain, and transform personal life, social relations, political institutions, economic organizations, and cultural and aesthetic conventions in society; promotes competencies required for various modes of mediated and nonmediated communication; and develops skills for analyzing, interpreting, and critiquing communication problems and questions.  The programs of study offered by the department thus provide a firm foundation for enriched personal living, for professional effectiveness regardless of the specific career one may pursue, and for informed participation in the human community.  Advising  Department advising for the major in communication studies is conducted by  1. a full-time lecturer/advisor who holds office hours in Swain Hall and  Steele Building (see the department’s Web site for the advisor’s office and office hours),  2. the director of undergraduate studies for the Department of  Communication (see the department’s Web site for the director’s office and office hours), and  3. representative faculty members.  Facilities  The department has extensive media production and performance studies facilities located in Swain Hall and Bingham Hall. Swain Hall is home to state-of-the-art media production equipment, classroom space, and editing suites. It also houses Studio 6, where numerous live performances are staged. Bingham Hall contains the Martha Nell Hardy Performance Space.  Graduate School and Career Opportunities  Upon completion of their degrees, students are prepared for graduate study and research in communication. Advanced study may be pursued in a problem-defined approach to communication research. A substantial number of graduate assistantships allow M.A.-through-Ph.D. and Ph.D.- only candidates to gain experience in research, teaching, production, and administration. Graduate study is characterized by intensive participation in seminars, original research and creative activities, and close work with  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            329  individual faculty members. Students are also prepared for advanced study in related academic disciplines such as law.  The career outlook for students with degrees in communication studies is promising, and graduates enter a variety of professions that value communication knowledge and skills. Communication studies majors are prepared to serve as communication specialists in business; in federal, state, and local governments and agencies; and in public service. Some of the specific areas in which majors pursue careers are teaching, social advocacy, public relations and advertising, personnel management and training, management consulting, video and film production, and work with emerging technologies.  An understanding of communication provides a strong base for a range of career options. The mission of the department is to go beyond narrow technical training by providing a liberal arts approach to communication. This provides the student with maximum latitude for promotion and advancement and avoids limited career opportunities resulting from narrow approaches to the field.  The burgeoning growth of communication industries and support fields provides a range of career opportunities. Graduates of the department, who number well over 4,000, are engaged in a variety of occupations ranging from work for international corporations to jobs at local nonprofit organizations.

Majors receive rigorous training in the foundations of computer science and the relevant mathematics, then have ample opportunity to specialize in advanced courses.  Majors can receive credit for practical training as a computing professional through an internship with a company or organization in the computing or information technology fields. Internships typically are paid positions and involve the student working off campus. All internships for credit must be approved in advance by the director of undergraduate studies. Students interested in pursuing such an internship should contact the director of undergraduate studies prior to the start of the internship.  Majors who excel in the program also have the opportunity to perform undergraduate research in computer science. Research projects may be pursued in conjunction with an existing graduate research group in the department and/or may be used as a vehicle for graduating with honors as described below.  Students with no prior programming experience should consider taking one of the introductory courses, COMP 110 or COMP 116. COMP 101 is intended for students who wish to develop a better understanding of computers in a context that does not involve programming. Students with prior programming experience should begin their studies with COMP 401. COMP 380 and COMP 388 are philosophical and moral reasoning Approaches courses that have no programming prerequisite.  Advising  In addition to general advising through the Academic Advising Program, students can consult designated faculty members within the Department of Computer Science who act as departmental advisors for requirements specific to the major or minor. Beyond course selection, advisors are also available for discussing internships, study abroad in computer science, honors projects, and undergraduate research opportunities. See the department Web site (http://www.cs.unc.edu) for a list of current department advisors.  Majors  • Computer Science Major, B.A. (p. 351) • Computer Science Major, B.S.

Notes on the Suggested Plan of Study A first formal course in computer programming (such as COMP 110) is a prerequisite for COMP 401. Students with no programming experience should begin their program of study with COMP 110. Students who are unsure if their background preparation enables them to begin their studies with COMP 401 are encouraged to consult a departmental advisor.  Students who are able to begin with COMP 401 may take it in their first semester and either advance the suggested program of study by one semester (giving themselves an extra free elective in their junior/senior years) or take another appropriate course such as a first-year seminar. In either case, neither COMP 110 nor a first-year seminar is a required course in the major.  This plan of study further assumes that students will place out of foreign language 1. If this is not the case, then the student should start with foreign language 1 (and have one fewer free elective in the senior year).  Special Opportunities in Computer Science Honors in Computer Science Students are eligible for graduation with honors if they complete the following requirements:  • A cumulative grade point average of 3.3 or better • A grade point average of 3.3 or better from among the set of COMP,  MATH, PHYS, and STOR courses taken to fulfill the graduation requirements for the major  • Graduation with honors requires the completion of two semesters of research (COMP 691H and COMP 692H). As part of COMP 692H, students must submit a written honors thesis and complete an oral public presentation of the thesis. Graduation with highest honors in computer science is possible for those students whose honors project and thesis are judged by a faculty committee to be particularly distinguished.  Students interested in pursuing honors in computer science are encouraged to contact the director of undergraduate studies. Experiential Education When arranged in advance with a supervising faculty member, COMP 293 can be used to earn credit for appropriate work experience in the summer. COMP 293 satisfies the experiential education requirement. COMP 495 and COMP 691H can also be used to satisfy the experiential education requirement. Another possibility is through study abroad (see below). Assistantships and Internships In addition to their classroom experiences, undergraduates may enhance their learning experience as research assistants or teaching assistants.  \f356         Computer Science Minor  Students also can participate in nationally recognized research programs or use the department's facilities to pursue self-directed research with a faculty member.  Work-study students can gain valuable work experience as assistants on the department’s computer services staff. The department also encourages students to pursue internship experiences. Carolina’s proximity to Research Triangle Park means that computer science majors have many internship and postgraduation opportunities available in their own backyard. Study Abroad Study abroad opportunities with priority for computer science students are offered through University College London (UCL) and the National University of Singapore (NUS) School of Computing.  UCL can accept UNC–Chapel Hill students for either a semester or yearlong exchange. For semester-only programs, UCL recommends registering for spring semester rather than fall as it better matches their academic calendar. Many courses satisfying the computer science B.S. requirements can be completed at UCL. UCL is located in the heart of London and is just a few blocks away from UNC–Chapel Hill’s European Study Center in Winston House.  NUS can accept UNC–Chapel Hill students for fall or spring semester, or a yearlong exchange. This exchange allows Carolina students to enroll directly into the NUS School of Computing and choose their courses from among the full offering. On a case-by-case basis, students may also be able to take other courses at NUS outside of the School of Computing. Study abroad at NUS is eligible for the Phillips Ambassadors Scholarship. Please see phillips.unc.edu (http://phillips.unc.edu) for more information.  Specific course equivalences for both schools are posted on the department’s Web site. Students interested in taking a course not listed should contact the director of undergraduate studies before registering for courses at the school.  Application for both programs is through the University’s Study Abroad Office. Application to the UCL programs and the NUS fall and yearlong programs takes place early in the spring of each year. Application for the NUS spring program takes place early in the fall of each year. Applicants for exchange participation must have completed at least one year of study at UNC–Chapel Hill and must have declared a computer science or precomputer science major. Study abroad satisfies the experiential education General Education requirement of the undergraduate curriculum. Undergraduate Awards The department awards two yearly prizes to computer science majors. In conjunction with SAS Institute, the department annually presents the Charles H. Dunham Scholarship. The Dunham scholarship includes a cash award to the student and a summer internship at SAS and is awarded in the spring semester to a student in their junior year. The department also annually presents the Stephen F. Weiss Award for Outstanding Achievement in Computer Science, which includes a cash prize. The Weiss award is presented to a student in the fall of the senior year.  Dual Bachelor’s–Master’s Degree Program  Students in the B.S. degree program with a GPA of 3.2 or better after five or more semesters of study have the option of applying to the dual B.S.– M.S. program at UNC–Chapel Hill to pursue graduate coursework leading  to the degree of master of science. Such students must complete the requirements for the bachelor of science degree within eight semesters. Upon completion of the B.S. degree, students then enroll as a graduate student to continue work towards the master of science degree.  The requirements for the master of science degree can be found in the Graduate Catalog. Generally, the master’s degree requires 30 additional hours of computer science coursework. Up to nine credit hours of computer science coursework taken while an undergraduate can be applied to the master’s degree if the coursework is not also used to satisfy the graduation requirements for the bachelor’s degree. The requirements for the master’s can be completed in as few as two additional semesters, for a total of 10 semesters of study.  Students interested in the dual-degree program should have completed (or be on track to complete) seven computer science courses at the 400 level or higher by the end of their sixth semester. Students must formally apply for admission to the combined B.S.–M.S. program, and it is expected that the application process would take place in the student’s sixth semester. Students applying in their sixth semester of study will be notified of the outcome of their application by the end of their sixth semester.  Students interested in the dual-degree program are strongly advised to consult the director of undergraduate studies in the Department of Computer Science in their sophomore year to discuss eligibility and an appropriate plan of study.

The same provisions apply, except that ECON 691H and ECON 692H must constitute two of the eight courses.  Note: STOR 113 is recommended for most economics majors. MATH 231 is recommended for students who plan to take the calculus sequence (MATH 231, MATH 232, and MATH 233). MATH 116 is not acceptable.  An economics major may apply as many as 15 economics courses, or 45 hours, toward the B.A. degree. ECON 101 will satisfy the social and behavioral sciences Approaches requirement, and the calculus course will satisfy the quantitative reasoning Foundations requirement. Both ECON 400 and ECON 570 satisfy the quantitative intensive Connections requirement.  Economics (ECON) course decriptions (p. 370).  Economics Major, NUS Joint Degree  UNC–Chapel Hill undergraduates can spend between two and four semesters at the National University of Singapore (NUS) and receive a joint bachelor of arts degree with a major in economics from both institutions. Qualified UNC–Chapel Hill students will have at least a 3.3 grade point average and can apply for the joint degree beginning in the second semester of their first year until the second semester of their junior year. UNC joint-degree students can decide how many semesters (between two and four) and at which point in their undergraduate career they would like to study at NUS, as long as it is after their first year at Carolina.  A minimum of 120 credit hours is required for graduation. They consist of a total of 60 hours in the major (including as many as six to 12 hours of honors work if applicable) and 45 hours of General Education requirements. The remaining 15 hours consist of electives, the Supplemental General Education requirement, and possibly one minor. All General Education and graduation requirements of both UNC–Chapel Hill and NUS must be met. A detailed listing of the requirements for both schools and how to satisfy those requirements is available at the UNC Study Abroad Office.  Special Opportunities in Economics Honors in Economics The Department of Economics honors program offers outstanding economics students the opportunity to work closely with an individual faculty member on a specialized research topic of the student’s choice during the senior year. Generally, students with a 3.5 grade point average in economics courses and 3.3 in all University coursework may be invited to participate in this two-course program (ECON 691H and ECON 692H).  In the first semester (ECON 691H), students become familiar with the recent literature on topics of major interest. Each candidate formulates an honors thesis proposal and initiates work on the project. In ECON 692H, the thesis work is conducted under the supervision of a faculty advisor who is a specialist in the general topic area of the research.  Near the end of the second semester (ECON 692H), the student stands for an oral examination on the thesis. Upon successful completion of the program, the student receives the bachelor of arts degree with honors or with highest honors. Students in the honors program are also required to complete at least an eight-course major rather than the minimum seven courses, including ECON 691H and ECON 692H. Departmental Involvement Undergraduates in economics have organized an active club, the Carolina Economics Club. Seminars, social activities, and greater interaction among students and with faculty have resulted from the formation of this on-going organization. The Club also has helped the Department of Economics conduct an annual job fair. All majors are invited to participate in this organization’s activities. In addition, the local chapter of Omicron Delta Epsilon, the national economics honor society, annually extends membership to those outstanding junior and senior economics majors who have demonstrated strong academic performance both overall and in their economics courses. Undergraduate Awards Each spring the Chancellor awards the Undergraduate Prize in Economics to the undergraduate student majoring in economics who has been judged the most outstanding on the basis of major and related course performances.

Our course offerings present a diversity of approaches to the study, production, and appreciation of literary and nonliterary texts. In our undergraduate program, we pursue a four-fold mission to  evaluate, and promote, in clear and forceful language, new ideas as well as civilizing influences of a shared past or an increasingly global present.

Advising  Because the major in comparative literature is a relatively small major, students and faculty members have the opportunity for frequent discussions. Majors should expect to work closely with the director of undergraduate studies and other faculty members in comparative literature to design and follow a coherent and cohesive plan of study in the major, as well as to consider options for independent research, study abroad, and honors thesis opportunities. Students are expected to review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester and work with advisors in Steele Building to ensure timely progress towards the degree.  All English majors have a primary academic advisor in Steele Building. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with their advisor and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. The department’s director of undergraduate studies works with current and prospective majors by appointment. Departmental academic advising is particularly important for those majors who are considering going on to graduate school. Further information on courses, undergraduate research opportunities, the honors program, careers, and graduate schools may be obtained from the department’s Web site.  Graduate School and Career Opportunities  Majors in English and comparative literature provide essential preparation for numerous career paths in business and government as well as in education, the law, and medicine.

Additional Information for Both Comparative Literature Concentrations Students may choose comparative literature as a second major, a particularly attractive option for those majoring in a foreign language because up to four of the foreign language major requirements can also count toward the 10-course major requirement in comparative literature.  Undergraduates majoring in comparative literature may minor in any department, curriculum, or school in which a minor is offered.  Majors should expect to work closely with the undergraduate advisor to design and follow a coherent, cohesive plan of study. Students who study abroad can generally apply their literature credits towards the major. Students completing the global cinema studies track may not complete a minor in global cinema studies.  All majors, regardless of their chosen track, must obtain at least a level 4 proficiency in a foreign language relevant to their individual area of interest. We strongly recommend that students in the global cinema studies track study as many film courses in the original languages as possible.  Sophomores planning to major in comparative literature should take one course under the Great Books I rubric, which treats ancient and premodern literatures, and one course under the Great Books II rubric, which treats literature from 1750 to the present. One of these courses can be used to fulfill the General Education literary arts Approaches requirement.  Special Opportunities in English and Comparative Literature Honors in Comparative Literature Majors with an overall 3.3 grade point average may elect to write an honors thesis by applying for permission to the director of undergraduate studies in the spring semester of their junior year. Students then register for CMPL 691H and CMPL 692H during their senior year. These courses may count as credit towards completion of the major. Students write the 50- to 70-page thesis on a comparative topic under the direction of any faculty member. The student conducts independent research during the summer between junior and senior years, often with the assistance of research funding. The first semester of the senior year involves regular tutorial sessions with the faculty advisor, as well as the completion of most of the writing of the thesis. In the spring students finish the process of writing and defend the completed thesis at an oral examination. For more information about the honors thesis in comparative literature, including examples of past thesis topics, please visit the English and Comparative Literature Honors Thesis Web site (http://englishcomplit.unc.edu/complit/undergraduate/honors_thesis). Honors in Creative Writing See “Creative Writing Minor (p. 414).\" Honors in English The Department offers at least two English honors seminars each semester. In addition, students seeking a degree with honors in English (a 3.3 cumulative grade point average and a 3.6 grade point average in major courses required) undertake a yearlong independent project during  \ftheir senior year (ENGL 691H and ENGL 692H) and usually produce a 40- to 50-page thesis. Students pursuing a degree with honors normally meet every week with the professors supervising their projects. This opportunity for individually directed research and writing often proves to be a high point of the student’s academic career. Study Abroad Some of the best programs offered at the University for study overseas are especially appropriate and useful to majors in the Department of English and Comparative Literature. These include semester or yearlong programs at Bristol, Manchester, Sussex, Edinburgh, Glasgow, and certain Australian universities. Students who have a minimum grade point average of 3.3 at the end of their sophomore year can participate in the King’s College Exchange Program at King’s College, London (representing either English or comparative literature). Special opportunities are also available at Oxford University and through the Joint Degree Program with the National University of Singapore. Comparative literature students most frequently travel to non-English-speaking destinations. For information on all overseas programs, see the Study Abroad Office or visit their Web site (http://studyabroad.unc.edu).  English Major, B.A. Contact Information Department of English and Comparative Literature http://englishcomplit.unc.edu Greenlaw Hall, CB# 3520 (919) 962-5481  Dr. Eliza Richards, Director of Undergraduate Studies ecr@email.unc.edu  Dr. Hilary Lithgow, Lecturer-Advisor lithgow@email.unc.edu  The major in English equips students to become incisive thinkers and powerful writers. At UNC, English majors develop these skills by learning to analyze a range of literary genres and cultural artifacts: from broadsides and books to digital archives and mp3s; from poetry and the novel to dramatic performance and film. The B.A. with a major in English foregrounds the inventive ways that individuals from various historical and cultural settings have engaged writing and artistic representation to understand—and remake—the world around them.  The core curriculum of the English major offers students a comprehensive overview of the history of English-language literature and thought, from their beginnings in the Middle Ages to the contemporary rise of English as a global language. The core also features introductory courses, which impart analytical, research, and writing skills that help students explore the relevance of literature and other media to questions of history, culture, and everyday life.  The B.A. launches English majors into a digital, global world with historical knowledge about what has shaped it. Because rigorous analysis of literary documents requires sensitivity to the context of their production, students who major in English enter this increasingly technological and transnational world with a crucial skill: the ability to think contextually. In learning to describe and analyze relations between an individual work and its social, cultural, and political environment, our students are equipped for the world outside of the university with the tools for solving a host of intellectual problems—medical, legal, technological, and beyond.

To meet certification requirements, students should take the following courses as part of, or in addition to, the English major (remaining within the 45-hour limit referenced above):  Three required courses: ENGL 313 ENGL 368  or ENGL 369  Grammar of Current English African American Literature, 1930-1970 H African American Literature, 1970 to the Present Southern American Literature H  ENGL 373 Two recommended courses:  ENGL 314 ENGL 374 ENGL 400 ENGL 401 ENGL 446 Total Hours  History of the English Language Southern Women Writers Advanced Composition for Teachers Advanced Composition for Elementary Teachers American Women Authors H  3 3  3  9  H Honors version available. An honors course fulfills the same  requirements as the nonhonors version of that course. Enrollment and GPA restrictions may apply.  Special Opportunities in English and Comparative Literature Honors in Comparative Literature Majors with an overall 3.3 grade point average may elect to write an honors thesis by applying for permission to the director of undergraduate studies in the spring semester of their junior year. Students then register for CMPL 691H and CMPL 692H during their senior year. These courses may count as credit towards completion of the major. Students write  \f412         Comparative Literature Minor  the 50- to 70-page thesis on a comparative topic under the direction of any faculty member. The student conducts independent research during the summer between junior and senior years, often with the assistance of research funding. The first semester of the senior year involves regular tutorial sessions with the faculty advisor, as well as the completion of most of the writing of the thesis. In the spring students finish the process of writing and defend the completed thesis at an oral examination. For more information about the honors thesis in comparative literature, including examples of past thesis topics, please visit the English and Comparative Literature Honors Thesis Web site (http://englishcomplit.unc.edu/complit/undergraduate/honors_thesis). Honors in Creative Writing See “Creative Writing Minor (p. 414).\" Honors in English The Department offers at least two English honors seminars each semester. In addition, students seeking a degree with honors in English (a 3.3 cumulative grade point average and a 3.6 grade point average in major courses required) undertake a yearlong independent project during their senior year (ENGL 691H and ENGL 692H) and usually produce a 40- to 50-page thesis. Students pursuing a degree with honors normally meet every week with the professors supervising their projects. This opportunity for individually directed research and writing often proves to be a high point of the student’s academic career. Study Abroad Some of the best programs offered at the University for study overseas are especially appropriate and useful to majors in the Department of English and Comparative Literature. These include semester or yearlong programs at Bristol, Manchester, Sussex, Edinburgh, Glasgow, and certain Australian universities. Students who have a minimum grade point average of 3.3 at the end of their sophomore year can participate in the King’s College Exchange Program at King’s College, London (representing either English or comparative literature). Special opportunities are also available at Oxford University and through the Joint Degree Program with the National University of Singapore. Comparative literature students most frequently travel to non-English-speaking destinations. For information on all overseas programs, see the Study Abroad Office or visit their Web site (http://studyabroad.unc.edu).

The Creative Writing Program offers a minor in creative writing. The minor requires 15 hours, a total of five courses, and may be earned in one of two ways:  1. by completing introductory, intermediate, advanced, and two-  semester senior honors classes in one genre; or  2. by completing five courses in any combination of genres.  Students need to begin work toward the minor at least by their sophomore year and may take one creative writing class per semester. Enrollment in courses beyond the introductory level is by permission only. Students must seek permission from the program’s director to declare the minor once they have taken two creative writing courses and are on track to graduate. Completion of a minor in creative writing is contingent on the student’s successful advancement through the sequence.  The Creative Writing Program also gives credit toward the minor for several courses offered in other departments, such as DRAM 231, COMM 330, COMM 433, and MEJO 256. To qualify for a degree with honors or highest honors in creative writing, students must maintain a 3.3 grade point average and meet all requirements both to enter and to complete the senior honors seminar (ENGL 693H and ENGL 694H). Students minoring in creative writing and planning to study abroad must plan carefully so that they meet all submission and deadline requirements for applying to successive courses. Writing classes offered by the UNC Friday Center for Continuing Education (correspondence, independent study, online) do not count toward the minor. The courses for the fiction track and poetry track are as follows: Fiction: ENGL 130  Introduction to Fiction Writing  3  or ENGL 132H First-Year Honors: Introduction to Fiction Writing  ENGL 206 ENGL 406 ENGL 693H & ENGL 694H  Intermediate Fiction Writing Advanced Fiction Writing Creative Writing Senior Honors Thesis, Part I and Creative Writing Senior Honors Thesis, Part II (a yearlong, two-semester senior workshop, which counts as two courses and can lead to graduation with honors or with highest honors in creative writing)  Poetry: ENGL 131  Introduction to Poetry Writing  or ENGL 133H First-Year Honors: Introduction to Poetry Writing  ENGL 207 ENGL 407 ENGL 693H & ENGL 694H  Intermediate Poetry Writing Advanced Poetry Writing Creative Writing Senior Honors Thesis, Part I and Creative Writing Senior Honors Thesis, Part II (a yearlong, two-semester senior workshop, which counts as two courses and can lead to graduation with honors or with highest honors in creative writing)  3 3 6  3  3 3 6  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            415  Other creative writing courses include: ENGL 138 ENGL 208 ENGL 209 ENGL 210 ENGL 306 ENGL 307 ENGL 309 ENGL 408 ENGL 409  Introduction to Creative Nonfiction Reading and Writing Creative Nonfiction Reading and Writing Children's Fiction Writing Young Adult Literature Playwriting Studies in Fiction and Poetry: Stylistics Theatrical Writing for the Puppet Stage Collaboration: Composers and Lyricists Lyrics and Lyricists: A Collaborative Exploration of the Processes of Popular-Song Lyric Writing Creative Writing: Special Topics  ENGL 490  3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3  3  ENGL 130, ENGL 131, ENGL 132H, ENGL 133H, and ENGL 138, the introductory classes, are prerequisites to other Creative Writing Program classes. ENGL 130, ENGL 131, and ENGL 138 are open for registration by rising sophomores only during spring semester for the following fall and for current sophomores only during fall semester for the following spring. Rising or current sophomores may register for ENGL 130, ENGL 131, or ENGL 138, but not for more than one of these three courses. Demand by sophomores regularly exceeds the number of seats available. Enrollment of juniors and seniors is on a space-available basis by permission of the instructor, and students may inquire of the instructor during the first week of classes to see if seats are available. ENGL 130, ENGL 131, and ENGL 138 are sometimes offered during summer sessions with no registration restrictions. Please always review summer session course listings for any changes or updates.  Advancement to successive courses in either the fiction or poetry sequence is by recommendation of the student’s previous instructor(s) and by application for both the advanced workshops and senior honors seminars. If possible, the student is assigned to a different instructor for each course. Should students not advance beyond the intermediate level, they may choose to finish the minor with other classes offered in creative writing. Creative writing minors receive priority in all creative writing classes and usually fill all seats.  Students completing the five courses for the minor may take additional creative writing courses only by permission of the director, providing that all other students still completing the minor are served first.  Again, please note that online courses do not count towards the creative writing minor. Transfer Students: Important Information The requirement for taking a minor in creative writing is five courses or 15 semester hours. Students are limited to one creative writing course per semester. Most junior transfer students have four semesters remaining. Junior transfer students wanting to minor in creative writing must either  1. Have an introductory course already on their record that will transfer  to Carolina as credit, e.g., an introductory course in fiction writing or poetry writing taken previously at a college or university that is transferring in as credit for ENGL 130 or ENGL 131; OR  2. Take an introductory course via UNC–Chapel Hill Summer School prior to their first fall term at Carolina and be promoted to the next level or to another creative writing class (on a space-available basis) in the fall of their junior year.  Permission to move forward with transfer credit for an introductory course requirement (Option 1 above) will require a review by the creative  \f416         English Minor  writing faculty of the syllabus and work completed in the course and is dependent on space availability, which cannot be guaranteed. Students must provide hard copies of syllabi and samples of coursework as early as possible in order to ensure time for review and to schedule a meeting with the director.  Junior transfer students fulfilling one of these two options would be eligible for Advanced Fiction or Poetry (ENGL 406 or ENGL 407) and the senior honors seminars (ENGL 693H and ENGL 694H) if there is space available in Intermediate Fiction (ENGL 206) or Intermediate Poetry (ENGL 207) their first fall semester, and if—on the basis of submitted work reviewed by a committee—they are chosen for those classes. If not, they would need to complete the minor using the multigenre approach.  Note: No more than two creative writing courses from other schools may be counted for credit at UNC–Chapel Hill. At least three of the five courses taken for the minor—courses designated ENGL—must be Creative Writing Program courses taken at Carolina.  Honors in Creating Writing  To qualify for a degree with honors or highest honors in creative writing, students must maintain a 3.3 grade point average and meet all requirements both to enter and to complete the senior honors seminar (ENGL 693H and ENGL 694H).

Latina/o Studies Minor Contact Information  Department of English and Comparative Literature http://englishcomplit.unc.edu Greenlaw Hall, CB# 3520 (919) 962-5481  Dr. María DeGuzmán deguzman@email.unc.edu  Dr. Hilary Lithgow, Lecturer-Advisor lithgow@email.unc.edu  Latina/o studies is constituted from the transdisciplinary study of Latina/ o cultural production and experience in terms of a whole variety of factors. Latinas/os are defined as people of Latin American and Iberian descent living and working or based in the United States, but also moving between the United States and the rest of the Americas. Latina/o studies takes as its primary concern the presence of Latin America, Spain, and the myriad combinations of Hispanic-Native-African-Asian and European non-Hispanic cultures within the borders of the United States. However, Latina/o studies is not confined within those borders to the extent that its subjects of study (and the very creators of the field itself) are in motion and in flux, coming and going, crossing borders and boundaries. In this respect it shares some of the transnational and transcultural scope, momentum, and issues of Latin American studies but with its own foci, its own perspectives. Latina/o studies does not duplicate the work of Latin American studies; it draws on it and complements it.  Latina/o studies encompasses Chicana/o studies, Puerto Rican studies, Cuban American studies, Dominican studies, Central American studies, South American studies, and so forth. It takes into account the cultural production and the socioeconomic and political experiences of a diverse population located in many parts of the country, not just in the Southwest borderlands.  The main stipulation of the minor is that students must take a combination of courses in the humanities (literatures and cultural production) and the social sciences (communities and cultural space), some of which have been designated as core courses and others as electives. Students who feel they need a basic introduction to Latina/o studies should take ENGL 364.

Cooke, Director of Undergraduate Studies amycooke@unc.edu  Violet Anderson, Student Services Manager vmanders@email.unc.edu  JAYE E. CABLE, Chair  Introduction  The Curriculum for the Environment and Ecology offers diverse and multidisciplinary undergraduate degree programs in environmental science (B.S.) and environmental studies (B.A.). Faculty throughout the University, including the College of Arts and Sciences and the schools of business, government, law, and public health, mentor students through courses, internships, and research opportunities. This unique approach provides students an opportunity to explore the knowledge base needed to understand the environment and its relationship to society, as well as the applications of that knowledge in areas such as environmental modeling; aquatic systems; environmental behavior and decisions; environmental change and human health; ecology, conservation, and biodiversity; and population and the environment. The degrees combine traditional classroom teaching with extensive use of interdisciplinary, team-based projects, internships, study abroad opportunities, and research.  Advising  The Curriculum for the Environment and Ecology maintains an advising system for students with an environmental interest. Students are encouraged to contact the director of undergraduate studies as early as they wish in their academic plan to discuss options and be assigned to a faculty advisor. Students may use the advising system from the time they enter UNC–Chapel Hill, obtaining advice from specialists in the various environmental fields. This advising system includes opportunities to meet with professionals from government, industry, and consulting to learn about the skills needed to work effectively in those fields if students are interested. In addition we routinely schedule seminars and host visitors who showcase career opportunities by their example in their respective fields.  Facilities  Curriculum faculty members and staff occupy offices and laboratories in Venable/Murray Halls (third floor) and the facilities in Manteo, Morehead City, and Highlands, NC.  Graduate School and Career Opportunities  A major in environmental science or studies prepares students for a variety of career options, including marine scientist, ecologist, environmental modeler, environmental policy maker, conservation advocate, land use planner, and environmental educator. Combining either major with other studies at the undergraduate or graduate level  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            421  can lead to careers as an environmental lawyer, epidemiologist, or environmental geneticist, to cite a few examples.

Dual Bachelor’s–Master’s Degree Program  Two dual bachelor’s–master’s programs are offered:  1. Environmental and Science Communication (esc.web.unc.edu (http://  esc.web.unc.edu)) is a collaboration between Environment and Ecology and the School of Media and Journalism; and  2. Environmental Informatics (dualesis.web.unc.edu (http://  dualesis.web.unc.edu)) is a collaboration between Environment and Ecology and the School of Information and Library Sciences.  Each program is designed for students to earn their bachelor’s degree and complete a master’s degree in a professional school in as little as five years. The dual degree in environmental and science communication is approached through the bachelor’s of arts degree with a major in environmental studies, and students then complete a master’s degree in journalism. The dual degree in environmental informatics is approached  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            435  through the bachelor’s of science degree with a major in environmental science, and students then complete a master’s in information sciences.  For the environmental science communication program, students must complete the undergraduate requirements for the B.A. degree in environmental studies and the graduate requirements for the M.A. degree in mass communication as separate degrees. For the environmental informatics program, students must complete the undergraduate requirements for the B.S. degree in environmental sciences and the graduate requirements for the M.S.I.S. degree in information sciences as separate degrees. Students may begin taking courses for the graduate degree while in the undergraduate program, and a limited number of credit hours of approved graduate coursework may be transferred into the graduate degree program in mass communication (up to nine hours) and information sciences (up to 12 hours). Courses taken as an undergraduate for graduate credit may not be counted as part of the undergraduate degree if the intent is to transfer them to the graduate program. Early advising is essential to success in navigating these dual- degree programs. Advisors are available in both units to help students prepare and select courses appropriately to get the most from their education.  Applying for the dual-degree program is a two-step process. It is highly recommend that interested first- and second-year students speak to an advisor early in their college program. Students must submit a conditional application to the program no later than their junior year to ensure that they will receive preference in registering for courses. Students must formally apply to the program through The Graduate School in their senior year. The GRE is not required for applications from current UNC–Chapel Hill students. For complete information on the application process and curriculum requirements, please go to esc.web.unc.edu (http://esc.web.unc.edu).  Special Opportunities in Environmental Science and Studies Honors in Environmental Science or Studies Students in either the B.S. or B.A. degree program may participate in honors research leading to graduation with honors or highest honors. This distinction is earned by participation in honors research (ENEC 693H) and culminates in ENEC 694H, thesis writing and defense. Students should follow the guidelines established by Honors Carolina and meet with the faculty honors advisor, Dr. Geoff Bell, to ensure that appropriate requirements are fulfilled (Requirements can be found on the Honors Program Web site (http://honorscarolina.unc.edu/current- students/honors-thesis-and-undergraduate-research/honors-thesis)). Honors students can use three credit hours of ENEC 693H (research) or ENEC 694H (thesis), but not both courses, to fulfill a concentration requirement. Departmental Involvement The Carolina Environmental Student Alliance (CESA) is an interdisciplinary organization dedicated to uniting the environmental interests of students across campus. Participation is open to all students and community members with an interest in the environment. The Epsilon Eta Environmental Honors Fraternity is an organization dedicated to excellence in environmental education. Interested students are nominated for membership. Experiential Education Possibilities for experiential education include APPLES service-learning courses (ENEC 593), Coral Reef Ecology and Management (ENEC 259),  \f436         Environmental Science, B.S.  Sierra Nevada Program (ENEC 208), internships (ENEC 393, ENEC 493), research (ENEC 395, ENEC 396, ENEC 698), and honors research (ENEC 693H, ENEC 694H). Additionally, a series of experiential education field sites is available in North Carolina and around the world where students may take coursework and conduct research for a semester. Fall semester field sites are offered in North Carolina at Highlands Biological Station (mountain/ecology), the Institute for Marine Sciences (marine ecology/geology), and the Coastal Studies Institute/Outer Banks (coastal policy and economics). Spring semester field sites are offered on the UNC campus (Sustainable Triangle field site), in Thailand (energy and pollution), and Ecuador (ecology or sustainable development). The Ecuador and Thailand field site experiences incorporate part of the following summer as well. Summer programs are offered at Cambridge, England (energy policy), and in the Galapagos (ecology). Contact our advisors about other opportunities. Faculty members often arrange Burch Program summer educational trips to such locations as Siberia, Russia (ecology and anthropology), the Sierra Nevadas (ecology and physical geography), and northern Europe (energy, sustainability, and communication). Internships Students are encouraged to apply for paid or unpaid internships in local, state, national, and international environmental organizations. Internship opportunities can be found through the environmental internships website (http://environmentalinternships.web.unc.edu). These internships provide valuable practical experience, and some may be conducted for academic credit. Study Abroad Exchange and other study abroad programs are available through the UNC Study Abroad Office. At some locations students may take courses for UNC credit, such as some field sites listed above. Students may take courses at other universities during study abroad and apply for transfer credit as well. We encourage students to participate in study abroad during their career at Carolina. Undergraduate Awards Undergraduates may be considered for the Watts and Betsy Carr Awards, Mary and Watts Hill Jr. Awards, and Robert Alonzo Winston Scholarships. Undergraduate Research All students are encouraged (but not required) to complete an independent or team research project. Such projects introduce students to the tools needed for graduate study. They also provide an important opportunity for working directly with the world-class environmental faculty members and graduate students at UNC–Chapel Hill, as well as in the many environmental organizations in the Research Triangle. The Triangle area contains one of the largest collections of environmental organizations and expertise in the world, providing unique opportunities for students to conduct research on an immense range of topics from fundamental scientific research to policy applications.

Special Opportunities in Environmental Science and Studies Honors in Environmental Science or Studies Students in either the B.S. or B.A. degree program may participate in honors research leading to graduation with honors or highest honors. This distinction is earned by participation in honors research (ENEC 693H) and culminates in ENEC 694H, thesis writing and defense. Students should follow the guidelines established by Honors Carolina and meet with the faculty honors advisor, Dr. Geoff Bell, to ensure that appropriate requirements are fulfilled (Requirements can be found on the Honors Program Web site (http://honorscarolina.unc.edu/current- students/honors-thesis-and-undergraduate-research/honors-thesis)). Honors students can use three credit hours of ENEC 693H (research) or ENEC 694H (thesis), but not both courses, to fulfill a concentration requirement. Departmental Involvement The Carolina Environmental Student Alliance (CESA) is an interdisciplinary organization dedicated to uniting the environmental interests of students across campus. Participation is open to all students and community members with an interest in the environment. The Epsilon Eta Environmental Honors Fraternity is an organization dedicated to excellence in environmental education. Interested students are nominated for membership. Experiential Education Possibilities for experiential education include APPLES service-learning courses (ENEC 593), Coral Reef Ecology and Management (ENEC 259), Sierra Nevada Program (ENEC 208), internships (ENEC 393, ENEC 493), research (ENEC 395, ENEC 396, ENEC 698), and honors research (ENEC 693H, ENEC 694H). Additionally, a series of experiential education field sites is available in North Carolina and around the world where students may take coursework and conduct research for a semester. Fall semester field sites are offered in North Carolina at Highlands Biological Station (mountain/ecology), the Institute for Marine Sciences (marine ecology/geology), and the Coastal Studies Institute/Outer Banks (coastal policy and economics). Spring semester field sites are offered on the UNC campus (Sustainable Triangle field site), in Thailand (energy and pollution), and Ecuador (ecology or sustainable development). The Ecuador and Thailand field site experiences incorporate part of the following summer as well. Summer programs are offered at Cambridge, England (energy policy), and in the Galapagos (ecology). Contact our advisors about other opportunities. Faculty members often arrange Burch Program summer educational trips to such locations as Siberia, Russia (ecology and anthropology), the Sierra Nevadas (ecology and physical geography), and northern Europe (energy, sustainability, and communication). Internships Students are encouraged to apply for paid or unpaid internships in local, state, national, and international environmental organizations. Internship opportunities can be found through the environmental internships website (http://environmentalinternships.web.unc.edu). These internships provide valuable practical experience, and some may be conducted for academic credit.  Study Abroad Exchange and other study abroad programs are available through the UNC Study Abroad Office. At some locations students may take courses for UNC credit, such as some field sites listed above. Students may take courses at other universities during study abroad and apply for transfer credit as well. We encourage students to participate in study abroad during their career at Carolina. Undergraduate Awards Undergraduates may be considered for the Watts and Betsy Carr Awards, Mary and Watts Hill Jr. Awards, and Robert Alonzo Winston Scholarships. Undergraduate Research All students are encouraged (but not required) to complete an independent or team research project. Such projects introduce students to the tools needed for graduate study. They also provide an important opportunity for working directly with the world-class environmental faculty members and graduate students at UNC–Chapel Hill, as well as in the many environmental organizations in the Research Triangle. The Triangle area contains one of the largest collections of environmental organizations and expertise in the world, providing unique opportunities for students to conduct research on an immense range of topics from fundamental scientific research to policy applications.

This multidisciplinary approach provides unique academic and research opportunities for students.  Advising  Student advising is overseen by the director of undergraduate studies; individual student advising is distributed among the department’s faculty members. Students interested in one of the concentrations will be advised and mentored by an environmental sciences and engineering faculty member whose expertise is relevant to the concentration. The program director and staff in the Student Services Office will verify that coursework requirements for the concentration have been met. Undergraduate students are encouraged to meet regularly with the program director and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. The program director and the Office of Student Services staff work with current and prospective majors by appointment (see contact information above). Departmental academic advising is particularly important for those majors who are considering going on to the dual bachelor’s– master’s degree. Further information on courses, undergraduate research opportunities, the honors program, careers, and graduate schools may be obtained from the department’s Web site.  Facilities  The Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering houses research laboratories located in Rosenau Hall, McGavran-Greenberg Hall, Michael Hooker Research Center, the Baity Building, and off- campus research facilities. These laboratories are involved in important research in water quality, biogeochemistry, atmospheric chemistry and air pollution, effects of environmental chemicals on DNA tissues and organisms, environmental and public health microbiology, and occupational health and safety.  The department also offers facilities for modeling and computational analysis of environmental systems, such as atmospheric circulation and air quality models, ground and surface water flow and transport models, fluid flow and contaminant transport models for indoor air environments, exposure analysis and health effects, risk assessment, and environmental epidemiology.  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            445  More detailed information about the individual laboratories and centers can be found at the department Web site (http://www.sph.unc.edu/envr).  Graduate School and Career Opportunities  While undergraduate education prepares students for citizenship in ways that go beyond professional concerns, the program in environmental health sciences also provides skills needed for employment and graduate study. Students ending their studies at the undergraduate level gain skills necessary to work in positions such as risk analysts in consulting firms and regulatory agencies; research assistants in local, state, and national environmental and environmental health departments; and scientific advisors to environmental organizations. The degree also prepares students for graduate study in the environmental sciences, environmental health sciences, environmental studies, toxicology, and professional disciplines such as medicine, environmental law, and public health.  Undergraduate students with appropriate science backgrounds have the opportunity to pursue a dual bachelor’s–master’s degree. This program allows students to complete a master’s degree in the department within one additional year of study beyond receipt of the bachelor’s degree. Interested students should read the program description and requirements carefully; they can be found online (http://sph.unc.edu/ envr/envr-degrees).  Students have opportunities to explore possibilities for employment through the rich network of connections among the department, University, and numerous environmental organizations in the Research Triangle Park area, which is home to the highest concentration of environmental health sciences groups in the nation.

The Exercise Oncology Laboratory is equipped with the latest  technology for the assessment of cardiorespiratory and pulmonary function, body composition, cognitive function, electrocardiogram monitoring capability, and evaluation of heart rate coherence and heart rate variability in oncology patients.  8. Through its clinical and research initiatives, the Matthew Gfeller  Sport-Related Traumatic Brain Injury Research Center demonstrates its commitment to providing the highest level of care for athletes of all ages suffering from sport-related brain injuries, and to assisting parents, coaches, and medical professionals in managing these athletes.  9. The Athletic Training Teaching Laboratory is designed for students to practice evaluation, treatment, and rehabilitation skills. It is equipped with treatment tables, evaluation tools, rehabilitation supplies such as foam rollers, exercises balls, and taping supplies.  Graduate School and Career Opportunities  Many undergraduate exercise and sport science majors are preparing for graduate work in related areas: exercise physiology, physical therapy, sports medicine, nutrition, athletic training, sports administration/ management, etc. They will be well-prepared for master’s and doctoral programs at major universities. Numerous opportunities exist for graduate assistantships in these areas at UNC–Chapel Hill and other large universities. Numerous career opportunities exist in a variety of fields directly related to sport and exercise. Some graduates go directly into health/fitness/sport-related employment. Others attend professional schools or pursue advanced academic degrees.

EMCH, Chair  Introduction  Geography is the science of space, place, and environment. The department offers classes spanning the social and natural sciences and offering students training in qualitative, quantitative, spatial analysis and modelling, and laboratory methodologies. Human geographers study the spatial aspects of human activity and physical geographers study patterns of climate, land forms, soils and water. Geographic tools and techniques—including Geographic Information Systems, remote sensing, and online and interactive mapping technologies—are among the most important for exploring and understanding our complex world. Geographic inquiry is global and local, inherently interdisciplinary, and offers skills that enable insights into pressing issues valued by employers and policy makers. For example, how does climate change impact the way we build cities? How does globalization influence where your jeans are made? How can health disparities between people be overcome through policy change? By synthesizing this knowledge, geographers create unique understandings of our complex world.  Career opportunities for geographers are wide ranging in the public, private, and nongovernmental sectors. Geographers work in the areas of social, health, and environmental policy; energy, transportation, economic, development, and tourism planning; urban and regional planning; research and education; community development; resource management; and environmental regulation and modeling.  With geography you can explore the world and find yourself.  Advising  All majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele Building. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with their advisor and review Tar Heel Tracker each semester. The department’s director of undergraduate studies works with current and prospective majors by appointment and during regular office hours (see department Web site as hours will vary by semester). Departmental academic advising is highly recommended for all majors, in particular those considering graduate school. Further information on courses, undergraduate research opportunities, the honors program, careers, and graduate schools may be obtained from the department’s Web site.  Facilities  The department has a range of specialized, state-of-the-art equipment for geospatial field sampling and laboratory analysis of data in hydrology, climatology, and vegetation science, including an ecohydrology laboratory and a dendrology laboratory. The department is wired internally to support the latest network technology. This network links  us to the centrally managed servers that provide access to a large library of software for geographic applications and research, as well as first-class library resources, data storage and backup, and access to supercomputing clusters.  Graduate School and Career Opportunities  There are a variety of job opportunities for geographers in government, business, industry, and the nonprofit sector. Geographers are hired for the following kinds of expertise: locational analysis, GISci, remote sensing, cartography, land use planning, recreation and tourism planning, and foreign area expertise. Many geographers pursue teaching at all levels.  Students with a B.A. major in geography from UNC–Chapel Hill are well trained for graduate programs in geography and other disciplines. Majors have entered graduate programs as diverse as city and regional planning, business, medicine, and ecology.

Geologists investigate diverse systems that play a large role in controlling the environment at the earth’s surface. Examples include earthquakes, volcanoes, glaciers, landslides, rivers, and shorelines. Earth processes play a critical role in making our planet habitable, and geologists are constantly in demand to guide communities and nations in their search for resources such as clean drinking water and extractable energy and minerals, or in decisions regarding development in fragile coastal regions or in seismically active areas. The Department of Geological Sciences provides students with a solid training in earth science so that they can advance in highly satisfying careers as professional geologists.  Most students planning to do graduate work or to become professional geologists should follow the B.S. program. However, the flexibility of the B.A. program may be advantageous to students with interest in, for example, environmental studies, education, or law.  Advising  All majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele Building. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with their advisor and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. The department’s director of undergraduate studies works with current and prospective majors by appointment. Departmental academic advising is particularly important for those majors who are considering going on to graduate school. Further information on courses, undergraduate research opportunities, the honors program, careers, and graduate schools may be obtained from the department’s Web site.  Facilities  The Department of Geological Sciences houses several laboratory facilities that are available for undergraduate students to use for research. Many students are introduced to the laboratory facilities through coursework. Laboratories include  1. a thermal ionization mass spectrometer for isotope and  geochronology research;  2. a scanning electron microscope laboratory for image analysis,  element mapping, and semi-quantitative chemical analysis; 3. an X-ray fluorescence spectrometer for chemical analysis of  geological materials;  4. an X-ray diffractometer for rapid mineral identification;  5. a direct current plasma spectrometer for analysis of major and minor  elements in sample solutions;  6. equipment for geophysical research and imaging, including portable broadband seismic stations, infrasonic microphones, a gravimeter, and equipment for ship-borne reflection seismology;  7. a sediment analysis laboratory including a coulometer, settling tube,  and laser particle size counter;  8. chemical and counting laboratories for quantifying natural and  artificial radioactivity at environmental levels;  9. a paleoclimate/paleoecology laboratory equipped for high-resolution  microsampling of carbonate samples for geochemical analysis.  Graduate School and Career Opportunities  Geologists commonly are employed by private industry, public and private schools, colleges and universities, and consulting firms (e.g., hydrology, environmental geology, engineering geology, petroleum geology, and mineral exploration). Geology graduates also can find jobs with federal or state geological surveys or with other federal/state environmental or energy firms. Some federal/state agencies prefer geologists with at least a master’s degree. A doctoral degree usually is required for employment at colleges and universities.

Special Opportunities in Germanic and Slavic Languages and Literatures Honors in Germanic and Slavic Languages and Literatures Students majoring in Germanic and Slavic languages and literatures who are qualified for honors work are strongly encouraged to consider taking honors during their senior year. Undertaking an honors project gives students the opportunity to explore a topic in depth under the direction of a faculty member. Seniors who wish to do honors work should confer with the director of undergraduate studies and choose an honors thesis advisor during the second semester of their junior year, and enroll during their senior year in GSLL 691H (honors reading and special studies) followed by GSLL 692H (writing the honors thesis). When GSLL 693H is offered, the course replaces GSLL 692H and provides an opportunity for students majoring in any of our concentrations to complete their thesis in the context of a small seminar with other honors students. One of these honors courses may count toward the major. Student Involvement and Cultural Enrichment beyond the Classroom Numerous social and educational events hosted by the department, as well as by student clubs such as the German Club, provide an atmosphere for effective learning and for enjoying German and Slavic culture. There are weekly opportunities in German, Russian, and other languages for informal conversation suitable for both beginning and advanced students. The department periodically sponsors lectures,  \f532         Germanic and Slavic Languages and Literatures Major, B.A.–German Media, Arts, and Culture Concentration  roundtables, small conferences, and film series for the various languages. Those considering an undergraduate major or minor should request to be added to the appropriate e-mail listserv for information regarding special events and opportunities.  The department also hosts receptions and informational meetings for students interested in pursuing a major or minor or seeking opportunities for internships, study abroad, graduate study, and employment in Germany, Russia, and Eastern or Central Europe. Every spring the department presents a Slavic and East European talent night, or Spektakl’, featuring skits, songs, puppet shows, plays, and poetry readings in the Slavic and East European languages students are learning. The department also presents full-length plays and dramatic readings in German performed by undergraduate students. Study Abroad The department encourages students to study and/or engage in internships abroad. These opportunities maximize students’ linguistic and cultural proficiency, particularly once they have acquired sufficient language skills to benefit most from this immersion experience. Students may participate for a whole year, a single term, or a summer.  The Study Abroad Office offers German programs at all universities in the German state of Baden-Württemberg, as well as a dedicated exchange program with the Eberhard-Karls-Universität Tübingen; at the Vienna (Austria) University of Economics and Business Administration; at the Science Exchanges in Berlin or Jena (Germany) and Vienna; at the IES European Union Program in Freiburg (Germany); and at the IES Music Studies Program in Vienna. Most German programs require that participating students have passed GERM 204 (or its equivalent); however, students with no prior knowledge of German may attend the FUBiS or FU-BEST programs in Berlin or the IES program in Freiburg. These programs generally include intensive language instruction in addition to content courses taught in English, and most programs offer an orientation course prior to the start of the semester. The yearlong term typically begins in late August and ends in late July, with a two-month vacation between semesters that many students use for travel. Students going abroad for only one term generally do so in the spring semester, which typically begins in late February and ends in late July.  The DAAD in conjunction with German universities usually offers some summer internships. An internship is also available in Dresden. Please see an undergraduate advisor in the department office about these opportunities.  Students who choose to study Dutch may study abroad in Amsterdam through the IES, or attend SIT Netherlands’ Program “International Perspective on Sexuality and Gender.” Exchange programs also are offered in Nijmegen and Groningen.  Students can study in semester or yearlong programs in Russia, including in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Vladimir, while earning credit towards their Carolina degree. Students also may participate in the ACTR Moscow summer program in Russia. UNC–Chapel Hill offers four semester- long programs and one summer program in the Czech Republic. For more information about these and other programs in eastern and central Europe, go to studyabroad.unc.edu. Majors and minors should consult with the director of undergraduate studies or the appropriate undergraduate advisor in advance of going abroad about courses they plan to take for the major or minor.  Languages across the Curriculum The Languages across the Curriculum (LAC) Program encourages majors and minors to enroll in one-credit-hour recitation or discussion sections that are conducted in German but associated with a variety of courses offered in English by other academic departments. German language recitation sections may also be scheduled in conjunction with several of the department’s courses offered in English. Each of these discussion and recitation sections counts as one German language credit (in addition to the credit granted for the course). Undergraduate Awards Membership in the Beta Rho chapter of Delta Phi Alpha, the German honors society, is available to majors and minors who have completed at least six credit hours of German language coursework at the 300 level and who have maintained high cumulative grade point averages and high grade point averages in the major.  The department selects annually one outstanding graduating senior majoring in German to receive the Undergraduate Ria Stambaugh Award for Excellence in German, a monetary award that is presented at the Chancellor’s Awards Ceremony each spring. Ria Stambaugh was a popular professor of German; after her death in 1984 her sister, friends, and colleagues contributed to a memorial fund to establish the Ria Stambaugh Awards. The undergraduate award was first presented in 1987.  Established in 1999, the Paul Debreczeny Prize is awarded each spring to a graduating senior whose work in Slavic languages and literatures has been judged outstanding. This monetary prize honors one of the founding faculty members of the program in Slavic languages and literatures. Undergraduate Research In addition to honors thesis work, students are encouraged to work on course-complementary or independent research projects with department faculty.

Undertaking an honors project gives students the opportunity to explore a topic in depth under the direction of a faculty member. Seniors who wish to do honors work should confer with the director of undergraduate studies and choose an honors thesis advisor during the second semester of their junior year, and enroll during their senior year in GSLL 691H (honors reading and special studies) followed by GSLL 692H (writing the honors thesis). When GSLL 693H is offered, the course replaces GSLL 692H and provides an opportunity for students majoring in any of our concentrations to complete their thesis in the context of a small seminar with other honors students. One of these honors courses may count toward the major. Student Involvement and Cultural Enrichment beyond the Classroom Numerous social and educational events hosted by the department, as well as by student clubs such as the German Club, provide an atmosphere for effective learning and for enjoying German and Slavic culture. There are weekly opportunities in German, Russian, and other languages for informal conversation suitable for both beginning and advanced students. The department periodically sponsors lectures, roundtables, small conferences, and film series for the various languages. Those considering an undergraduate major or minor should request to be added to the appropriate e-mail listserv for information regarding special events and opportunities.  The department also hosts receptions and informational meetings for students interested in pursuing a major or minor or seeking opportunities for internships, study abroad, graduate study, and employment in  \fGermany, Russia, and Eastern or Central Europe. Every spring the department presents a Slavic and East European talent night, or Spektakl’, featuring skits, songs, puppet shows, plays, and poetry readings in the Slavic and East European languages students are learning. The department also presents full-length plays and dramatic readings in German performed by undergraduate students. Study Abroad The department encourages students to study and/or engage in internships abroad. These opportunities maximize students’ linguistic and cultural proficiency, particularly once they have acquired sufficient language skills to benefit most from this immersion experience. Students may participate for a whole year, a single term, or a summer.  The Study Abroad Office offers German programs at all universities in the German state of Baden-Württemberg, as well as a dedicated exchange program with the Eberhard-Karls-Universität Tübingen; at the Vienna (Austria) University of Economics and Business Administration; at the Science Exchanges in Berlin or Jena (Germany) and Vienna; at the IES European Union Program in Freiburg (Germany); and at the IES Music Studies Program in Vienna. Most German programs require that participating students have passed GERM 204 (or its equivalent); however, students with no prior knowledge of German may attend the FUBiS or FU-BEST programs in Berlin or the IES program in Freiburg. These programs generally include intensive language instruction in addition to content courses taught in English, and most programs offer an orientation course prior to the start of the semester. The yearlong term typically begins in late August and ends in late July, with a two-month vacation between semesters that many students use for travel. Students going abroad for only one term generally do so in the spring semester, which typically begins in late February and ends in late July.  The DAAD in conjunction with German universities usually offers some summer internships. An internship is also available in Dresden. Please see an undergraduate advisor in the department office about these opportunities.  Students who choose to study Dutch may study abroad in Amsterdam through the IES, or attend SIT Netherlands’ Program “International Perspective on Sexuality and Gender.” Exchange programs also are offered in Nijmegen and Groningen.  Students can study in semester or yearlong programs in Russia, including in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Vladimir, while earning credit towards their Carolina degree. Students also may participate in the ACTR Moscow summer program in Russia. UNC–Chapel Hill offers four semester- long programs and one summer program in the Czech Republic. For more information about these and other programs in eastern and central Europe, go to studyabroad.unc.edu. Majors and minors should consult with the director of undergraduate studies or the appropriate undergraduate advisor in advance of going abroad about courses they plan to take for the major or minor. Languages across the Curriculum The Languages across the Curriculum (LAC) Program encourages majors and minors to enroll in one-credit-hour recitation or discussion sections that are conducted in German but associated with a variety of courses offered in English by other academic departments. German language recitation sections may also be scheduled in conjunction with several of the department’s courses offered in English. Each of these discussion and recitation sections counts as one German language credit (in addition to the credit granted for the course).  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            539  Undergraduate Awards Membership in the Beta Rho chapter of Delta Phi Alpha, the German honors society, is available to majors and minors who have completed at least six credit hours of German language coursework at the 300 level and who have maintained high cumulative grade point averages and high grade point averages in the major.  The department selects annually one outstanding graduating senior majoring in German to receive the Undergraduate Ria Stambaugh Award for Excellence in German, a monetary award that is presented at the Chancellor’s Awards Ceremony each spring. Ria Stambaugh was a popular professor of German; after her death in 1984 her sister, friends, and colleagues contributed to a memorial fund to establish the Ria Stambaugh Awards. The undergraduate award was first presented in 1987.  Established in 1999, the Paul Debreczeny Prize is awarded each spring to a graduating senior whose work in Slavic languages and literatures has been judged outstanding. This monetary prize honors one of the founding faculty members of the program in Slavic languages and literatures. Undergraduate Research In addition to honors thesis work, students are encouraged to work on course-complementary or independent research projects with department faculty. Funding may be available through the Office of Undergraduate Research.

The Curriculum in Global Studies offers an interdisciplinary program of study focusing on these and many other issues. It draws on courses throughout the social sciences, humanities, and professional schools and offers students the chance to concentrate on an area of the world and a theme of global significance.  Students prepare for careers in business, diplomacy, international aid, economic development, and other forms of public service. The global studies major is also excellent preparation for graduate school in one of the social sciences, in professions such as law, business, and journalism, or in international affairs and area studies. About 450 juniors and seniors major in global studies.  Advising  All majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele Building. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with their advisor and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. The department’s director of undergraduate studies works with current and prospective majors by appointment (see “Contact Information” above) to discuss major requirements, how study abroad credits transfer into the major, and other issues of relevance to global studies. Further information on courses, the honors program, internships, and more are available on the department’s Web site.  Graduate School and Career Opportunities  Global studies majors are prepared for careers in business, diplomacy, international aid and economic development, and other forms of public service. The major is also excellent preparation for graduate school in one of the social sciences; in professions such as law, business, or journalism; or in international affairs and area studies.

Additional Information The curriculum urges that in addition to fulfilling requirements, students continue the study of a foreign language to a level as close as possible to fluency. All majors should also make every effort to include a study abroad program in their undergraduate education, preferably in their sophomore or junior year.  Students must complete all General Education requirements. No courses fulfilling major requirements may be taken Pass/Fail.  Special Opportunities in Global Studies Honors in Global Studies Honors study involves the completion of a substantial piece of original research and the formal presentation of the results in an honors thesis and oral defense. Those who successfully complete the program are awarded their B.A. degree with either honors or highest honors in global studies. Students who wish to submit a thesis for honors in global studies must have at least a 3.3 cumulative grade point average and, under normal circumstances, a 3.5 grade point average in the major and must enroll in GLBL 691H and GLBL 692H. GLBL 692H may count toward the major as a theme or area studies course with departmental approval. GLBL 691H will count as elective credit only. Each prospective honors student must submit a two- to three-page prospectus outlining his/her project in the fall of the junior year. Students accepted into the global studies honors program will enroll in GLBL 691H in the spring of the junior year and GLBL 692H in the fall of the senior year. Study Abroad (recommended, but optional) Global studies majors are strongly urged to gain experiential knowledge of the countries and thematic concerns they are studying through participation in an approved study abroad program appropriate to their areas of concentration. Every effort will be made by the curriculum to  \fUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            551  integrate study abroad courses into the major. Students must receive course approval from the director of undergraduate studies prior to departure for a program abroad. No credit will be given unless programs are preapproved. Undergraduate Awards All majors in the Curriculum in Global Studies who study abroad are considered for two study abroad awards that are presented each year. These funds may be used to defray any expenses associated with studying abroad.  The Michael L. and Matthew L. Boyatt Award Fund provides several meritorious awards each year of no more than $2,500 each. They are designated for majors who want to participate in a study abroad program pertinent to their area of concentration within global studies.  The Laura Hudson Richards Fund provides one award of $2,500 each year to a major in the Curriculum in Global Studies who demonstrates both academic excellence and financial need.  In addition, each spring the curriculum awards the Douglas Eyre Prize to the student writing the best honors thesis. The curriculum also selects an annual recipient of the Anne Scaff Award for service to the curriculum and for internationalizing the College. Students chosen to receive the Eyre Prize and Scaff Award are recognized at the curriculum’s spring commencement ceremony.  \f552         Department of Health Policy and Management  Department of Health Policy and Management Contact Information  Department of Health Policy and Management www.sph.unc.edu/hpm (http://www.sph.unc.edu/hpm) Rosenau Hall, CB# 7411 (919) 966-4609  Karl Umble, Program Director umble@email.unc.edu  Jackie Siler, Student Services/Assistant Registrar, Department of Health Policy and Management jsiler@email.unc.edu  SHOOU-YIH DANIEL LEE, Chair  Introduction  The mission of the BSPH program in health policy and management is to develop responsible graduates who have the necessary knowledge, skills, and values to pursue successful careers in health systems in the United States and abroad.  Advising  All students are assigned a faculty advisor in the department. Faculty advisors work collaboratively with the program director, office of student services, and career services coordinator to support students’ academic, professional development, and career services needs.  Graduate School and Career Opportunities  The program aims to prepare students for both entry-level positions and advanced degree programs. Graduates obtain positions in a variety of organizations, such as health care consulting firms, hospitals, health systems, physician practices, local public health departments, government agencies (e.g., Centers for Disease Control), health research organizations (e.g., Research Triangle Institute), community health organizations, health insurance companies, health technology organizations, universities, and global health organizations (e.g., Peace Corps).  Graduates also have successfully pursued advanced degrees in a range of fields, such as health management, public health, public policy, accounting, law, medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, and business administration.

History Major, NUS Joint Degree  History majors may wish to consider applying for the Joint Degree Program, an innovative undergraduate degree program joining UNC– Chapel Hill and the National University of Singapore, one of the top universities in Asia and the world. UNC–Chapel Hill undergraduates spend from two to four semesters at the National University of Singapore and receive a joint bachelor of arts degree with a major in history from both institutions. For further information about the Joint Degree Program, see the department Web site (http://history.unc.edu/undergraduate- program/joint-degree-program-with-the-national-university-of-singapore) or contact the Study Abroad Office and the director of undergraduate studies in the Department of History.  Special Opportunities in History Honors in History The departmental honors program is open to any qualified history major with at least a 3.3 cumulative grade point average and, under normal circumstances, a 3.4 in history courses, and experience in  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            585  research and writing derived from an undergraduate seminar in history (HIST 398). The student pursuing a degree in history with honors must take HIST 691H and HIST 692H; these two courses contribute credit hours toward fulfilling field-of-concentration requirements, depending on the topic of the thesis. The student, in consultation with the honors director, will choose a topic and locate an appropriate faculty member to supervise a senior honors thesis. In HIST 691H the mechanics of researching and writing a senior essay will be discussed and a start made on the essay itself. In HIST 692H the essay will be completed and the student examined by the supervisor and at least one additional faculty member to be agreed upon by the student and supervisor. To receive highest honors the essay must be recommended by the examiners and a review committee. The director of honors, in consultation with the examiners and review committee, will recommend that the student who has defended the essay graduate with either honors or highest honors, or merely with course credit. Students should submit applications for the honors program by the end of February during their junior year. For detailed guidelines click here (http://history.unc.edu/undergraduate- program/senior-honors-thesis) or contact the director of honors in the Department of History. Departmental Involvement Students with broad interests in the intellectual and social life of the department may volunteer to serve on the department’s Undergraduate Studies Committee (UGSC). Each spring the department invites majors to volunteer for the UGSC, and the selection is made at the start of the next fall semester by the faculty members on the UGSC. Students may also plan or participate in activities organized by the Undergraduate History Club as well as, for those who are eligible, UNC–Chapel Hill’s chapter of Phi Alpha Theta (described more fully below under “Undergraduate Awards”). For more information about the UGSC, the History Club, and Phi Alpha Theta, see department’s Web site or contact the coordinator for undergraduate studies in the Department of History. Experiential Education In some cases, students majoring in history may wish to pursue internship opportunities. Questions and requests regarding internships should be directed to the department’s lecturer/advisor, who has responsibility for evaluating internship proposals and deciding whether an internship may be taken for academic credit. For more information, click here (http://history.unc.edu/undergraduate-program/internship- opportunities-for-history-majors).  All history majors will receive credit for the experiential education (EE) General Education requirement when they complete HIST 398. Study Abroad The department strongly encourages its students to explore the many study abroad opportunities provided by the Study Abroad Office. The experience of studying abroad opens intellectual horizons that can be glimpsed only in unfamiliar worlds, and it deepens one’s appreciation for the enduring power of historical context and circumstance.  The Department of History participates in a unique joint degree program with the National University of Singapore. The department also has an exchange program with King’s College in London. For further information about both programs, contact the Study Abroad Office and the director of undergraduate studies in the department. General information for history majors wishing to study abroad can be found on the department's Web site (http://history.unc.edu/undergraduate-program/study-abroad).  \f586         History Minor  Undergraduate Awards All majors who complete the required undergraduate seminar (HIST 398) are automatically eligible for the annual Joshua Meador Prize, awarded to the author of the best seminar paper written in the preceding calendar year. A named prize is also awarded to the author of the best honors thesis; the award is announced at the annual spring honors banquet.  The Department of History sponsors a chapter of Phi Alpha Theta, the national history honor society. Students who have taken 12 hours of history courses at UNC–Chapel Hill and who have an overall grade point average of 3.0 and an average in history courses of 3.1 are eligible to apply for membership. An announcement regarding applications for Phi Alpha Theta will be distributed to all history majors in the fall semester. Undergraduate Research The Department of History encourages undergraduate research in a variety of ways. The required seminar for majors (HIST 398) introduces students to historical research. The senior honors program (HIST 691H and HIST 692H) gives students an opportunity to carry out a yearlong research project. In both the fall and spring semesters, senior honors students may apply for competitive awards, including the Michael L. and Matthew L. Boyatt Awards in History for Undergraduate Research and the David Anthony Kusa Undergraduate Research Award, to help support travel for the purpose of research.

In the past, students have designed their own majors in such varied fields as medieval studies, food studies, arts management, medical geography, healthcare policy, medical humanities, cultural studies, behavioral finance, urban studies, documentary studies, computational physics, and enthnobotany.  Advising  Appointments may be made with James Thompson. Inquiries may be made through e-mail (uthomp@email.unc.edu). Students should come prepared with a draft of their major proposal. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with their advisor and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester.  Graduate School and Career Opportunities  Since IDST can provide a broad background in the liberal arts, graduate study in a number of academic disciplines is possible. Students are encouraged to contact the graduate or professional school to which they wish to gain admission to determine the specific undergraduate academic requirements necessary for admission. An IDST major is generally not recommended for students planning graduate study in the sciences, but many students combine majors aimed at medical, legal, or business careers with an IDST major.  Career opportunities for IDST majors are as varied as the reasons students give for selecting the major.

Special Opportunities in Latin American Studies Honors in Latin American Studies Latin American studies majors with an overall grade point average of 3.3 are invited to pursue a degree with honors by writing an honors thesis during the senior year. Each honors thesis is written under the direction of an appropriate faculty advisor; when completed, the thesis must be defended orally before an examining board of faculty members. Honors candidates enroll in the two honors courses (LTAM 691H and LTAM 692H). LTAM 691H counts as a course in the student’s concentration. Experiential Education Students who are particularly committed to field experience or experiential education in Latin America may be able to arrange for this through independent study credit. Students wishing to do so should have the academic support of a regular faculty member and contact the institute’s associate director well in advance of the semester in which the experience is to take place. Intensive Yucatec Maya Each summer the Consortium in Latin American and Caribbean Studies at the University of North Carolina and Duke University offers intensive instruction in modern Yucatec Maya, with a secondary focus on ancient, colonial, and modern Maya culture. The courses include classroom instruction in Chapel Hill (LTAM 411) or in Mérida, Mexico (LTAM 512 and LTAM 690), and a field study experience in Yucatán, Mexico. See the  \f596         Latin American Studies Major, B.A.  Maya program (http://isa.unc.edu/language-programs/yucatec-maya- institute) Web site for current course information. Independent Study Any student may enroll in independent study (LTAM 396) with the permission of the curriculum faculty advisor and the agreement of a Latin American or Caribbean studies faculty member who will supervise the student’s independent study project. This course may be used to fulfill the requirements of the major, and it is often linked to internships or to undergraduate grants for summer research travel. Study Abroad Study abroad is not a requirement of the major; however, living and studying in Latin America or the Caribbean is highly recommended as an experience that majors should consider. The UNC–Chapel Hill Study Abroad Office offers a broad range of programs in Latin America and the Caribbean. Visit the Study Abroad Office Web site at studyabroad.unc.edu (http://studyabroad.unc.edu). ISA and the Study Abroad Office offer competitive scholarships for majors wishing to undertake study in Latin America and the Caribbean. Undergraduate Awards Each year UNC–Chapel Hill offers funding opportunities for students conducting research or studying abroad in Latin America or the Caribbean. These include the Julia Crane, Halpern, and Mellon Awards. The Federico Gil award recognizes the best undergraduate honors thesis written on a Latin American or Caribbean topic. Contact the director of undergraduate studies for information. Undergraduate Research Latin American Studies majors are eligible to develop a senior thesis project in their last year. The thesis may be related to a field work project the summer after the junior year. A small number of grants might be available for undergraduate field research in Latin America, especially in connection with a senior thesis.  \fUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            597  or editing and publishing; some careers in these areas may require a graduate degree.

UNC–Chapel Hill offers several degrees in mathematics and the mathematical sciences, providing students a choice of careers in this field. Among the jobs in industry, government, and the academic world that involve mathematics are actuary, analyst, modeler, optimizer, statistician, and computer analyst.  Students intending to teach mathematics in elementary and middle school and students enrolled in the School of Education who intend to major in mathematics should consult the School of Education section of the Catalog or the director of mathematical education in the Department of Mathematics. A section below suggests course selections for future high school teachers.  Advising  All majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele Building. Students should regularly meet with their advisors and review their Tar Heel Trackers to be sure that they are satisfying distribution and degree requirements. In addition, junior and senior majors are assigned each semester a mathematics faculty member as an advisor with whom they must meet to discuss course selections and any other questions before a hold on registration is lifted. The department’s director of undergraduate studies and assistant (see contact information above) are also available by appointment. Further information on courses, undergraduate research opportunities, the honors program, careers, and graduate schools may be obtained from the department’s Web site (http://www.math.unc.edu).  Placement into Mathematics Courses  Standardized test scores such as the Advanced Placement (AP), Scholastic Achievement Test Subject Levels I or II (SAT), or the American College Test (ACT) can be used for placement into mathematics courses. Please visit the placement page (http://math.unc.edu/for-undergrads/ placement-info) of the department’s Web site for specific information regarding placement.  Graduate School and Career Opportunities  The B.S. degree program, especially if it includes the sequences MATH 521–MATH 522 and MATH 577–MATH 578, is excellent preparation for graduate study in the mathematical sciences. The B.A. degree can be excellent preparation for graduate study in many fields, including admission into professional schools of law, business, and  medicine. Both degrees are viewed by many employers as attractive, especially when accompanied by electives in areas such as statistics, computer science, economics, and operations research. Undergraduate mathematics majors with critical thinking skills and good analytical abilities are in demand in many business, industry, and government fields.

LEE (History), Chair  Introduction  Peace and war are among the oldest dreams and most difficult challenges of human experience. The curriculum brings together faculty and courses from many disciplines to provide undergraduates with a range of approaches to the fundamental issues of human conflict and national and global security and defense. The curriculum prepares majors for graduate work in several of the humanities and social sciences, for a variety of professional schools, and for a range of employment. Graduates have found employment with federal agencies, state and local governments, banks, and other businesses. Others have attended graduate and professional schools in government, history, international relations, and law. The strength of the curriculum is its broad interdisciplinary perspective combined with its depth of focus on topics that span the range of human experience across time and national boundaries, from science and technology to ethics and public policy. In addition to coursework, the curriculum sponsors guest speakers and field trips, and provides majors with help and advice on internships and career planning.  Advising  All majors have a primary academic advisor in Steele Building. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with their advisor and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. The curriculum’s student services manager and the chair work with current and prospective majors by appointment (see contact information above).

For more information contact Carolyn Pumphrey at (919) 613-9280 or pumphrey@duke.edu. Experiential Education Internship courses provide students with the opportunity to earn academic credit while obtaining practical work experience in agencies and organizations clearly related to national and international security. In recent years students have served in these and other agencies: The Central Intelligence Agency, Durham Police Department, Office of Naval Intelligence, Defense Intelligence Agency, Carolina for Kibera, Center for Strategic and International Studies, Peace Action, United States Army Special Operations Command, and many more. Students are limited to one internship for credit, and all internships are limited to three hours of academic credit. Although some routine administrative tasks are required in any professional setting, the expectation is that a majority of the intern’s work will be directed toward the substantive mission of the agency and that tasks will be of a nature to justify awarding academic credit. All internships require prior approval, and all must consist of at least eight hours per week and at least 100 hours per semester. Students must sign an internship contract with their agency and faculty supervisors, setting out expectations and course requirements. Interns are required to keep a daily internship journal. Once approved for an internship, students enroll in PWAD 393, which is offered on a Pass/ Fail basis only and does not count toward the nine courses required for the major. Students wishing credit towards the major derived from their internship work should pursue an independent study with a faculty supervisor either while taking the internship or in the next semester. That independent study should produce a major written product, would be graded normally, and receives credit in the major. Study Abroad The curriculum encourages all undergraduates to study abroad either for a summer, a semester, or an entire year. Students should consult the study abroad (http://studyabroad.unc.edu) Web site and visit the Study Abroad Office as early as possible in their course of study to meet with a study abroad advisor. A number of foreign programs contain courses that qualify for major credit. Of particular usefulness is study at the King’s College, University of London War Studies Department, the closest analogue to the Curriculum in Peace, War, and Defense in the English- speaking world and a program with a renowned faculty. Students with at least a 3.3 grade point average are eligible to apply to King’s College. While supervision arrangements need to be negotiated and agreed with relevant faculty members, students writing honors theses in their senior year may also apply to spend the year at King’s College. Undergraduate Research Students who qualify are encouraged to experience original research by writing a senior honors thesis described in the honors section above.  \fDepartment of Philosophy Contact Information  Department of Philosophy http://philosophy.unc.edu Caldwell Hall, 240 East Cameron, CB# 3125 (919) 962-7291  Professor Mariska Leunissen, Director of Undergraduate Studies mariska@email.unc.edu  MARC LANGE, Chair  Introduction  The principal goal of the study of philosophy is to enable students to think more clearly, deeply, and appreciatively about themselves and their world. Study of philosophy enhances analytical, critical, and interpretive capacities that are applicable to any subject matter in almost any context. It provides many opportunities for expressing oneself, for reflecting on questions that human beings have pondered for millennia, for exchanging reasoned beliefs and engaging in focused debate, and for learning how to come to terms with problems for which there are no easy answers. A good philosophical education also helps to prepare students for responsible and intelligent participation in political and community affairs.  The most important outcome of philosophical study is the ability to engage in thinking that is at once disciplined and imaginatively creative. While such thinking lies at the heart of the philosophical enterprise, it is also needed for success in any complex intellectual or practical endeavor. Philosophy’s attention to critical thought, rigorous argument, and articulate expression makes the philosophical curriculum absolutely central to a liberal education and valuable as a basis for further training in a variety of pursuits.  Examples of philosophical questions are  • How should we understand truth, existence, validity, fact, value, free  will?  • What are the principles or presuppositions of science, language,  political systems, religious and moral views?  • What is the nature of a person, of space and time, of a work of art? • What is the wisdom of the past on these enduring questions? How  can we learn from people such as Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, and Kant?  Students are encouraged to view philosophy not as a specialized, esoteric discipline, but instead as an activity integral to a liberal arts education, helping students to think more cogently and appreciatively about themselves and their world.  PHIL 101, PHIL 110, or PHIL 112 is recommended as a first course for those interested in philosophical issues and their cultural significance and for those who wish to examine a broad range of philosophical topics, problems, or historical figures. Other good starting points are PHIL 155, which deals with logic and the analysis of argument; PHIL 160, which deals with moral thought and experience; and PHIL 150, which deals with the concepts, methods, and foundations of the biological and physical sciences.  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            667  PHIL 155 is recommended for all students who major or minor in philosophy.  Advising  All majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele Building. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with their advisor and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. The department’s director of undergraduate studies works with current and prospective majors by appointment (see contact information above). Departmental academic advising is particularly important for those majors who are considering going on to graduate school. Further information on courses, undergraduate research opportunities, the honors program, careers, and graduate schools may be obtained from the department’s Web site.  Graduate School and Career Opportunities  A major in philosophy offers excellent preparation for many careers in which clear thinking and analytical ability are valued. Some majors choose to pursue graduate work in philosophy in preparation for college or university teaching (Ph.D. normally required), but the philosophy major also provides the form of rigorous and systematic intellectual training that is of crucial importance in law, medicine, business, and other fields.

PHIL–Philosophy  Courses numbered below 199 have no prerequisites. These serve as suitable first courses in philosophy for many students, as do some courses below 299, in particular PHIL 230, PHIL 266, and PHIL 280. Courses numbered 101 to 120 are general survey courses. Courses numbered 130 to 290 are oriented toward particular problems or topics. Courses numbered 210 to 229 concern the history of philosophy. Courses numbered 300 to 399 are designed for advanced undergraduates and majors and carry a prerequisite of one course in philosophy. (Some may carry additional prerequisites.) Courses between 400 and 699 are for advanced undergraduates as well as graduate students. Detailed information on upcoming courses is available on the department’s Web site.  Please note that not all courses are offered on a regular basis. For information on which courses are most likely to be offered in a given year or semester, please contact the department’s director of undergraduate studies. Undergraduate-level Courses PHIL 51.
