### This is the repository for PlanCarolina, a revolutionary new way to plan your course of study at UNC.
# Our Philosophy
> At UNC there are endless opportunities; however, those endless options can be overwhelming especially with only four years to seize them. We found ourselves rewriting our four-year plans over and over again on pieces of paper each time we took that art history or philosophy class and instantly wanted to add another major or minor. Could we fit it in? What about study abroad? The erasing and reoutlining became onerous, especially with the confusing UNC academic worksheets. Out of this frustration grew PlanCarolina, a tool that we hope will help you explore your indecisiveness efficiently. We are a team of three Juniors studying Computer Science, Linguistics, Economics, Math, and... who knows? We hope PlanCarolina will help you plan out your four years at this school of national champions! Cheers to planning!
